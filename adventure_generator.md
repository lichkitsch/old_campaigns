## Supplication
The Suppliant appeals to the Power in authority for deliverance from the Persecutor.
1. Someone is in custody facing punishment and, for some reason, must be set free. This could be a party member, an innocent NPC, or a liar.
2. First, the party must find their way in to see the Power.
3. Then, the party is blocked by the Persecutor in some way.
4. The Suppliant is revealed to be a liar, the Persecutor had a trick up their sleeve, or the Power is unwilling to comply.
5. Fight or pursuit breaks out between the party and either the Suppliant or the Power and/or the Persecutor.
6. The Suppliant is delivered from custody, the Power/Persecutor is defeated, and the party claims their reward. A secret is uncovered, some hidden context for the adventure or NPCs is provided, or a clear path to the next adventure is revealed.

## Deliverance
The Unfortunate has caused a conflict, and the Threatener is to carry out justice, but the Rescuer saves the Unfortunate.

This is the same as Supplication but without a Power in authority to appeal to, just the Threatener.

## Revenge
The Criminal commits a crime that will not see justice, so the Avenger seeks justice by punishing the Criminal.
1. Someone approaches the party to assist in carrying out vengeance, or the party has been wronged by the Criminal.
2. The party must find the Criminal's location and make their way inside unharmed and typically unseen.
3. There is an obstacle standing between the party and the Criminal such as traps, allies of the target, social milieu, or difficult terrain.
4. The Criminal is in another location, has a twin who committed the crime, owns a sleeping dragon, is being saught out by another assassin, holds a double life as an upstanding citizen, etc.
5. The Criminal or the party is cornered and the battle ensues.
6. The Criminal is revealed to be innocent, the crime was far worse than previously believed, the Criminal escaped while the party fought his allies but left clues or riches, etc.
