# How to Play

## Actions, Tasks, and Effect Dice
When a player wants to do something where the outcome is uncertain they make an action roll. Action rolls consist of roll 1d20 and applying bonuses or penalties to get a result that is higher than the current __Air of Fate__.

### Air of Fate
The __Air of Fate__ is a number between 8 and 18 that is shared with the players which represents the level of difficulty the party is currently up against. The __Air of Fate__ can be represented by a d20, and this number will change depending on the scene but generally the further into the story you go, the __Air of Fate__ rises.

### Tasks
Things that players want to do have hit points (HP) that represent the progress required to complete the task. Many actions are pass/fail and can be thought of as having only 1 HP, but difficult tasks like breaking down a tough door or picking a lock will have at least 10 HP.

When a player rolls a successful attempt at a task they will then roll their effect dice and use the result to reduce the task's HP. In this sense, combat can be thought of as completing the task "defeat my opponent."
