# Narrativity
A 1-page tabletop role-playing game for adventures in any setting or genre.

## Requirements
- Pen and paper
- Three six-sided dice
- A copy of these rules

This is a collaborative storytelling game in which players control characters (PC) living in and exploring an imaginary world. The Game Master (GM) takes control of the world and environment, creates and plays all the non-player characters (NPCs), and guides the players through the adventure(s).

## Actions
When a PC wants to take an action in the game world, the GM decides if it is free, like reading a sign in your native language or walking through an unlocked door. If an action comes with any uncertainty it will require a skill check.

### Skill Checks
To make a skill check, the PC first states what they want to do and what trait they want to use. The PC rolls 3d6, then adds (or subtracts) their trait modifier to the result and the GM narrates the effect in the story and on the game world.

There are a total of six possible outcomes for skill checks listed below that will answer the question Did the PC succeed…?

| Result | Outcome |
|:---:|:---:|
| < 5 (or all 1s) | “No, and…” | 
| 5, 6, 7 | “No.” |
| 8, 9, 10 | “No, but…” |
| 11, 12, 13 | “Yes, but…” |
| 14, 15, 16 | “Yes.” |
| > 16 (or all 6s) | “Yes, and…” |

Not only can you succeed or fail a skill check, you might also get an extra positive or negative effect depending on the roll.

### Traits

Characters have six traits that can be used in a skill check which represent their strengths and faults. When building a new character roll 3d6 for each of the following:

- **Vitality (VI)** represents health and endurance.
- **Strength (ST)** represents power and muscle.
- **Agility (AG)** represents dexterity and acrobatics.
- **Intellect (IN)** represents logic and critical thinking.
- **Wisdom (WI)** represents faith, will, and perception.
- **Charisma (CH)** represents appeal and personality.

| Trait Score | Modifier |
|:---:|:---:|
| < 5 | -3 |
| 5, 6 | -2 |
| 7, 8, 9 | -1 |
| 10, 11 | 0 |
| 12, 13, 14 | +1 |
| 15, 16 | +2 |
| > 16 | +3 |

Based on these traits you can make some basic assumptions about the character’s life. High **ST** and low **IN**? Maybe they are more of an athlete. High **WI** and low **AG**? They could be a wise old scholar. Then give them a name, description, etc.

### Contests
When there is a conflict you can resolve it with a contest, rolling two different skill checks and seeing which result is higher. I.e. someone trying to strike a target would roll a **ST** check and the target would roll **AG** to dodge or **VI** to withstand the blow, while telling a lie (**CH**) might be defended with **IN**, **WI**, or **CH**. The traits being used will depend on the situation and the actions being taken by the initiator and the target. In the event of a tie, the initiator fails in a “No, but…” outcome.

### Re-rolls
The GM decides if the player can take the same action again and re-roll for a better result.

## Bonuses
Through the course of the game, PCs might encounter items that give them a helping hand by adding a +1 modifier to a specific trait. For example, weapons might increase **ST** or **AG** while books might increase **IT**, **WI**, or **CH** depending on the content within. If a PC finds protective clothing they might add +1 to their **VI** modifier while wearing it. When a PC acquires an object, the GM should always specify whether it is a one-time use item or not.

The GM can also choose to reward temporary bonuses to a PC for accomplishments in the game like clever thinking or good teamwork.

## Penalties
If something happens to the PC that affects them (that is not an injury), like they eat expired meat or awaken to find that someone shaved all their hair off, they might receive a -1 penalty to a trait. For the above situations, the PC might suffer -1 to future **VI** and **CH** skill checks, respectively. 

Penalties should almost always be the result of failing at a skill check. For instance, both of the examples listed could arise from failed **WI** checks. The PC can then try to find a way to remove the penalty through narrative means, like taking medicine or wearing a wig.

## Injuries
If a check or a contest results in a character sustaining an injury then they must remove a point from their **VI** score (but keep their **VI** modifier).

If an injury is severe, like falling from a tall building, they might lose many (possibly all) of their **VI** points. If an injury brings their **VI** score down to zero, that character passes out and cannot be woken unless they are healed. If there is no help around, they take any more injuries while they are at a **VI** of zero, or the injury in question would send their **VI** into the negative, the character dies. This may or may not mean the end of the game for the PC, depending on how your party decides to handle resurrection and/or the afterlife.

## Healing
Whether by medicine or magic, all PCs that have sustained injuries can regain **VI** points in the appropriate situation. They might seek out a doctor (or have one in the party), rest for a time, drink a healing tonic, or find favor with a deity. The GM might have some healing sources require a skill check before **VI** points are rewarded, such as an **AG** check by a surgeon or a **WI** check by a cleric. The points regained should fit the scenario and they should never exceed the PC’s original **VI** score.

## Gamemastering
Whoever steps up to be GM carries a lot of responsibility. They must play the roles of host, guide, architect, tactician, referee, narrator, and also all the NPCs in the game world. The GM must be ready to bring to life a variety of settings, histories, events, and many other details to give the players a clear idea of their goals and maneuver the plot of the story around the unexpected actions that the PCs might take. Having maps to reference is good, but also make a list of names that match the setting of the game world in case your party decides to wander into the town hall and talk to the mayor (who you didn’t plan to be involved, but, there they go). 

It’s important that the GM gives their players agency, but if the party is wandering a little too far from the main story you can try to gently nudge them back in the right direction without breaking immersion.

When designing mysteries for your players to solve, make sure every conclusion you want them to come to has at least three clues tied to it, and don’t waste your player’s time by making them roll to reveal important clues; the fun part is always in the deduction, not the search.

Have fun and don’t be afraid to tweak these rules as needed.
