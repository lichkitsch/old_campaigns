_dnduet_ is a system for creating and playing custom tabletop rpgs for two, one game master and one player. The game master is responsible for creating the game world and narrating the actions of NPCs, while the player controls the protagonist(s) of the story.

When a character makes an action and the result is uncertain, the one controlling them rolls 1d20 against a target number, either the _Air of Fate_ or another character's 1d20 roll, to reveal the result.
