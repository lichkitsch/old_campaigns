## Help Emmanuel
### Hook
Visit Emmanuel at the Library, see his collection, receive the quest, and a secret that will help Ifir.

### Gateway
Head to the Maison du Souvenir to speak with Armand's brother, Louis. (Twist, the funeral is in progress when Ifir arrives) Ifir is invited to celebrate Armand's life with them.

*Maison du Souvenir*
- Cut stone walls, marble pillars, wooden doors, stained glass windows
- Stale air mixed with the gentle, sweet smell of flowers
- Muffled sounds of a crowd beyond the doors
- Tapestries and painted portraits adorn the walls
- Crowd of mourners waiting inside, dressed in black clothing, some crying most not

### Trial
Whispers lead Ifir to a dark corner where she is confronted by the ghost of the Alchemist himself. Armand must be convinced to allow Ifir to take his skull back to the Library and let Emmanuel call upon him to give lessons.

### Twist
Armand's body is possessed by the ghost of his old rival, a sorcerer named Corbeau. Corbeau is pissed that Armand failed to save him from his illness and "let him die".

### Climax
The doors seal shut and Corbeau uses fire magic to try and bring the building down. Armand can enter his body and distract Corbeau while Ifir helps by either breaking the body, trapping Corbeau, or putting out the fires.

### Reward
Armand thanks Ifir for her help once Corbeau is defeated, and upon returning to Emmanuel with the alchemist's skull he reveals that he has met Anabushka and that she's been attempting to find Ifir, but that she wasn't in the city. He can call upon her and Anabushka can explain to Ifir that she knows a way to get to the moon and rescue Polaris.











After working the first day, jobs change. Vela ends up in the hospital, training under Sal, and Ilien takes her place as a scribe in the library. Ezrah moves up to operating the crane and is quite happy with the development.

Anabushka can bring Ifir to the moon to rescue Polaris but they must go alone.

Maybe Polaris puts up a fight? The helm might have some will of its own.

Polaris is going to be unresponsive once the helm is removed; her overflowing anger and pain pushed her to her limit and she needs a well-deserved break.
