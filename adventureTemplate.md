# Name of Adventure

## Setup
When and where are we? Set the stage, introduce relevant NPCs, etc.

### The Goal
What problem is the party trying to solve?

## Encounter 1 (or 2) - Entrance with Guardian
What's the first immediate obstacle the party must overcome to cross the threshold into unknown territory?

## Encounter 2 (or 1) - Puzzle/RP Challenge
What's the second obstacle sitting between the party and the solution to the problem? One of these first two encounters should be combat, one should be interaction, and both should have elements of exploration.

## Encounter 3 - Trick/Setback
Something happens that flips the party on its head. This is the plot twist; someone is kidnapped, dies, betrays the party, etc. and the party must scramble to get back on track.

## Encounter 4 - Climax
This is the big showdown, the end of the line. By the end of this encounter the problem from the beginning will have a solution, for better or worse.

## Reward/Revelation
Solving the problem has either caused some new problem or revealed some previously hidden knowledge.
