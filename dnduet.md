Roll `1d4-2` for the following:

| Traits       | Effort   |
|:------------:|:--------:|
| Strength     | Hands    |
| Dexterity    | Tools    |
| Constitution | Magic    |
| Intelligence | Critical |
| Wisdom       |          |
| Charisma     |          |

To do something, roll `1d20` and add the most relevant score. If the result is higher than the *Air of Fate* then the action or attempt is successful.

Obstacles that aren't pass/fail require effort to overcome. Successful attempts to overcome an obstacle allow the player to subtract the following from its HP:

1. `1d4+Hands` if not using tools or magic and the roll was not a natural 20.
2. `1d4+1d6+Tools` if using tools.
3. `1d4+1d8+Magic` if using magic.
4. `1d4+1d12+Critical` if the roll was a natural 20.

When an obstacle's HP reaches zero it is overcome.

Your character has HP as well, and armor for defending against attacks. Characters start with 10+CON HP and 10+DEX armor. Armor cannot be higher than 15. Hostile creatures must roll higher than your character's armor to deal damage.

Characters get 2 perks and 2 quirks. Perks give the character advantage on specific action rolls. Quirks give disadvantage on specific action rolls. Both are based on your character's unique history, ancestry, shape, training, studies, background, etc. The bonus/penalty is tied to a specific narrative trait: a thief might get advantage while picking locks or +2 to disabling traps, but disadvantage on avoiding fire damage due to a traumatic experience from their past. Perks and quirks can also be added or removed temporarily or permanently through significant narrative events or critical fumbles.

See LINK for more perk/quirk examples.

When you're character's reached a significant milestone, the GM will let you level up. Add 2d4 to your max HP and, if you want, reroll as many times as your constution bonus. You also get a permanent +1 to any trait or effort, with a maximum of 5.
