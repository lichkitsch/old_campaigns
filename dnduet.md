# **dnduet** Player's Guide
dnduet (Daring Narrative Duet) is a two-player tabletop roleplaying system. The player controls one or more characters (PCs) living in a world controlled by the dungeon master (DM). You work together to create an exciting and interesting story.

## Characters
Characters have several stats which make them unique. These stats give them advantages and disadvantages. To make a character, start with:

Traits
roll 1d4-2 each
Focuses
2 points to distribute
Strength (STR)
Dexterity (DEX)
Constitution (CON)
Intelligence (INT)
Wisdom (WIS)
Charisma (CHA)
Combat
Burglary
Nature
Arcana
Religion
Society

Now you know your character’s strengths and weaknesses. Next, calculate these two numbers:

Heart Points (HP)
Armor Class (AC)
Max HP = 10+CON
10+DEX or 10+STR

With this information you can choose to describe the following aspects of your character:

Body
Appearance, demeanor, and voice
Mind
Education, profession, and fears
Heart
History, values, family, and desires
Assets
Connections, possessions, and money

Based on this backstory for your character, give them a perk and a quirk. Perks and quirks make actions under specific conditions automatically easy or hard (explained later). For example, a falconer might have a knack for handling birds, but a fear of drowning that impedes their actions while around rushing water.

## Actions
When an action has a chance of failure, you make an action roll by rolling 1d20 and adding a trait score. The specific trait will depend on the nature of the action:

Add STR for power, athletics, or muscle
Add DEX for agility, stealth, or sleight-of-hand
Add CON for endurance, health, or stamina
Add INT for logic, memory, or knowledge
Add WIS for perception, intuition, or accuracy
Add CHA for persuasion, manipulation, or allure
After rolling and adding your trait score, check the result against the Air of Fate. The Air of Fate is a number between 3 and 18 set by the DM that represents the current level of difficulty. Obstacles can also be easy (AoF-3) or hard (AoF+3).
The Air of Fate is not a secret; both the player and the DM should be able to see it in plain view.
If the result is equal to or higher than the Air of Fate, the action succeeds. If the obstacle has HP, roll effect dice based on your level:
L1
1d4
L5
2d6
L9
3d10
L2
1d6
L6
2d8
L10
3d12
L3
1d8
L7
2d10
L11
4d10
L4
1d10
L8
2d12
L12
4d12
Add your relevant focus bonus, if applicable, and subtract the result from the target’s HP.
When the HP of the obstacle reaches zero, it is overcome/completed. HP represents a combination of skill, luck, the will to live, and integrity (physical, emotional, and mental).
Failing Forward
If the result of an action is lower than the Air of Fate or a natural 1 (rolling a 1 before applying bonuses or penalties), the action fails. PCs always fail in a way that moves the story forward.
You might fail the action because of a narrative development, forcing the PC to find a new path to progress. They might instead succeed in the action but take on a new, temporary, related quirk as the cost of success. The DM should decide the result of a failed roll based on the situation. In the event of a natural 1, the quirk you take becomes permanent.
Helpful Objects
PCs have an inventory where they keep useful items collected throughout their journey. This includes clothing, armor, weaponry, food, potions, books, tools, and more. Some items boost a character stat; armor might add a point or two to your armor class, for instance.
Work with your DM to figure out the uses, bonuses, and penalties for the items your character acquires. Remember that no roll can have higher than a +8 and armor class cannot be higher than 18. Keep item bonuses/penalties to 1 or 2 points.
Distance and Time
Distance as it relates to the PC are close (5ft radius), near (10ft radius), and far (further than 10ft). Time comes in moments (seconds to minutes), hours, and days.
Combat
Sometimes PCs are facing hostile forces and need to protect themselves. When the party enters combat, everyone rolls initiative.
Initiative is the order that everyone takes their turns during combat. To find your place in the initiative order, make a DEX action roll. DMs roll once for each type of creature, not each enemy.
If a PC is unseen, they can make a sneak attack and deal some damage before the initiative roll.
On your turn you can take two actions, a movement and an action, or a far movement. Enemies must roll higher than your AC to deal damage.
When their HP reaches zero, your character falls unconscious and they see a glimpse of the world beyond the veil…
Death
PCs can only die if the player allows for it. Sacrifice always results in positive effects on the story and party members. For example, the character might take out a major villain or give their life to protect someone else from destruction. 
If the PC or party is in dire straits, the DM must continue the narrative in a thoughtful way, like imprisonment or the arrival of allies. Think in terms of episodic TV shows: main characters tend to die only when it moves the story forward.
Leveling Up
When your character reaches a milestone, add 1 point to any trait or focus score, with a max score of 5 for each. Add the following to your max HP:
L1
10+CON
L5
3d6
L9
3d12
L2
2d4
L6
3d6
L10
3d12
L3
2d4
L7
3d6
L11
3d12
L4
2d4
L8
3d6
L12
5d10
You can re-roll the same amount of dice as your CON score. The DM might also reward a level up with new gear or treasure.
When a PC reaches L12, they have reached their potential. If you wish to continue playing them, you have two choices: age or rebirth. For age, continue leveling but with every level past 12 you lose 2d8 max HP (no re-rolls), and every other level past 12 you lose 1 trait point. When their max HP reaches or passes zero, you decide how they finally die.
Rebirth means they start fresh at level 1 as the result of a narrative event, such as becoming soul-bound to an object for a century or ascending to a new plane of existence.
House Rules
If something in the rules doesn’t work for you, change it! Make it your own and remember that what’s important is having fun.
