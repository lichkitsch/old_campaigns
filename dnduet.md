Roll `1d4-2` for the following:

| Traits       | Effort   |
|:------------:|:--------:|
| Strength     | Hands    |
| Dexterity    | Tools    |
| Constitution | Magic    |
| Intelligence | Critical |
| Wisdom       |          |
| Charisma     |          |

To do something, roll `1d20` and add the most relevant score. If the result is higher than the *Air of Fate* then the action or attempt is successful.

Obstacles that aren't pass/fail require effort to overcome. Successful attempts to overcome an obstacle allow the player to subtract the following from its HP:

1. `1d4+Hands` if not using tools or magic and the roll was not a natural 20.
2. `1d4+1d6+Tools` if using tools.
3. `1d4+1d8+Magic` if using magic.
4. `1d4+1d12+Critical` if the roll was a natural 20.

When an obstacle's HP reaches zero it is overcome.
