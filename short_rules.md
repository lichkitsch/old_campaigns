Roll `1d4-2` for the following:

💪 🎯 💊 📚 👁 💖 ✋ 🛠 🔮 ⭐️ 

🛡= 10 + 🎯  
❤️ = 10 + 💊

When success is not guaranteed, roll 1d20 and add...

1. 💪 for power, athletics, and muscle. 
2. 🎯 for reflexes, agility, and nimbleness. 
3. 💊 for health, endurance, and stamina. 
4. 📚 for logic, memory, and knowledge. 
5. 👁 for will, intuition, and perception. 
6. 💖 for allure, appeal, and manipulation. 

If higher than the *Air of Fate*, the action is successful.

*Air of Fate*
: Publicly visible number between 8 and 18 that represents the current level of challenge for the players.

If the outcome is a task and not pass/fail, roll...

1. `1d4+✋` if unaided. 
2. `1d4+1d6+🛠` if aided by physical means. 
3. `1d4+1d8+🔮` if aided by metaphysical means. 
4. `1d4+1d12+⭐️` if you rolled natural 20. 

Subtract the result from the task's ❤️. Task is complete when its ❤️ reaches zero.

Magic Cost
: If action is aided by metaphysical means, subtract the 1d4 result from your ❤️. Magic draws on the user's life force for energy.

Failure results in a narrative twist that prevents success **or** partial success which adds a temporary condition based on the following:

1. 💪-2 due to injury.
2. 🎯-2 due to hunger.
3. 💊-2 due to illness.
4. 📚-2 due to anger.
5. 👁-2 due to exhaustion.
6. 💖-2 due to fear.

Hostile creatures must roll higher than your 🛡 to deal damage to your ❤️.

When your character earns it, add +1 to any trait and 2d4 to your ❤️. Reroll 💊 times, if you want.
