💪 🎯 💊 📚 👁 💖 ✋ 🛠 🔮 ⭐️ 

🛡 = 10 + 🎯  
❤️ = 10 + 💊

To do something you could fail, roll 1d20 and add...

1. 💪 for athletics and muscle. 
2. 🎯 for reflexes, agility, and nimbleness. 
3. 💊 for health, endurance, and stamina. 
4. 📚 for logic, memory, and knowledge. 
5. 👁 for will, intuition, and perception. 
6. 💖 for allure, appeal, and manipulation. 

If higher than the *Air of Fate*, the action is successful.

*Air of Fate*
: Publicly visible number between 8 and 18 that represents the current level of challenge for the players.

If the outcome is not pass/fail, roll...

1. `1d4+✋` if unaided. 
2. `1d4+1d6+🛠` if aided by physical means. 
3. `1d4+1d8+🔮` if aided by metaphysical means. 
4. `1d4+1d12+⭐️` if you rolled natural 20.
