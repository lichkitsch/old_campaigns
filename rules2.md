# How to Play YARPG

YARPG (Yet Another Role-Playing Game) is a roleplaying game in which players control characters living in a fantasy world described by the game master (GM). Player characters (PCs) take actions within the world that move the narrative forward, rolling polyhedral dice and applying bonuses and penalties to determine the outcome. For an action or an attempt at a task to be successful, the result of the action roll and its modifiers must be higher than the **Air of Fate**, a visible number between 3 and 18 that indicates the level of difficulty the PCs currently face.

## Tasks and Effect Dice
While some actions are pass/fail such as leaping over a gap or lifting a heavy chest, other actions might take multiple attempts or time to complete. These types of actions are called tasks. Tasks come with hit points (HP) which represent the effort required to complete it. When an action roll against a task is successful, PCs roll the relevant effect dice, add their bonus if applicable, and subtract the result from the task's HP. When the task's HP reaches zero it is finished or, in the case of taking down an enemy, defeated.

## Bonuses and Penalties
Characters and creatures have six traits and four effect dice, all of which can come with bonuses or penalties to action and attempt rolls.

### Traits
1. Strength: power, muscle, and melee attacks
2. Dexterity: reflexes, agility, stealth, and sneak or ranged attacks
3. Constitution: health, endurance, and stamina
4. Intelligence: logic, memory, and critical thought
5. Wisdom: willpower, faith, intuition, and perception
6. Charisma: appeal, allure, leadership, and manipulation

### Effect Dice
**Basic Effect**
Successful attempts always roll 1d4, but the bonus is only applied if the attempt is not aided by tools or magic and it was not a critical success.
**Tool Effect (TLE)**
When an attempt is aided with a tool or weapon, roll 1d4+1d6+TLE.
**Magic Effect (MGE)**
Casting spells or using magic powers costs the character 1d4 HP. When an attempt is aided by magic, roll 1d4+1d8+MGE and subtract 1d4 HP from your max HP.
**Critical Effect (CRE)**
When the attempt roll is a 20 before any bonuses or penalties are applied it is considered a critical and you roll 1d4+1d12+CRE.

Characters gain points that they can spend to increase their trait or effect bonuses, but no one trait or effect bonus can be higher than 5. When creating a new character, players can either choose to distribute 5 points amongst their trait and effect bonuses or they can roll 1d4-2 for each trait and effect for a more random starting character build.

## Advantage and Disadvantage
When the situation or conditions under which the task is being attempted is favorable or dangerous the GM might give the PC advantage or disadvantage on their roll. Advantage is rolling 2d20 and keeping the higher roll, and disadvantage is rolling 2d20 and keeping the lower roll. If the GM wants to give a minor challenge or benefit to the action or attempt, they can simply boost or lower the **Air of Fate** by 2 for that particular task.

## Perks and Quirks
Characters start out with 2 perks and 2 quirks. Perks and quirks are strengths and weaknesses unique to your character based on their shape, background, ancestry, training, study, etc. They have some tangible effect on your character under certain conditions. Perks might include wings for flight, 2 extra damage to undead creatures, or advantage on all sneak attacks. Quirks, on the other hand, might include a fear of fire, -2 armor in hot climates, and disadvantage on stealth checks. Perks and quirks are tied to the narrative; if something about the character changes, temporarily or permanently, they might be removed, new ones added, or their effect changed in some way. The GM determines when a character removes or receives perks and quirks based on their character choices and actions.

## Gear
Characters carry helpful objects with them such as currency, clothing, armor, tools, weapons, spellbooks, potions, and more. Keep track of the things to which your character has access and update this list as they lose and gain items throughout their journey. Some special items might increase your character's ability to avoid damage, heal a certain amount of HP, or reduce the cost for spellcasting. Keep the item's effect low, and if it does have a high effect consider adding a cost to using the item in the form of trait/effect penalties, receiving disadvantage more often, etc. The GM and PCs should work together to tell the best story possible, not to compete with one another.

## Armor and HP
Every character has armor and hit points (HP). Hostile creatures in the game world might attack the PCs, but to land an attack and deal damage they must roll higher than your character’s armor, which is 10 plus bonuses/penalties from the character's dexterity or constitution, the armor they are wearing, and their perks/quirks. A character's armor cannot be higher than 18. For characters, hit points represent the amount of damage they can take before they fall unconscious.

On their turn, an unconscious character can roll their d20. On a critical hit they wake on their own with 1 HP. If they roll a critical fail they permanently lose one point of their constitution bonus. Allies and NPCs can help the character by healing them, defending them, or removing them from danger, but if their HP reaches -10 or they roll a critical fail with a constitution of -1 or less, they die.

How your group handles death is up to you. Do they continue adventuring as a ghost? Will the party brave the spectral plane to retrieve their ally? Or was their death honorable and they pass on to the next life? Maybe it's a darker story and the character is gone forever, with no chance of bringing them back. You, as a group, decide.

## Failure
If a character doesn’t roll higher than the **Air of Fate** the GM can resolve the failure one of two ways: introduce a narrative twist or add a temporary quirk. Twists change the situation and give the player new choices, whereas quirks act as a cost for the action’s success. For example, a failed roll on pickpocketing could either see the thief caught red-handed or the stolen item could be terrifying and temporarily add a “scared straight” quirk. Rolling a 1 before any bonus or penalty makes the quirk permanent.

## Character Progression
When the PCs accomplish something great, such as at the end of an story arc or after a significant event, the GM might let them level up. This means they add 2d6 to their max HP and receive 1 extra point to apply to their trait or effect bonuses.

Characters should grow and change throughout the game, not necessarily at specific intervals. If a PC gets to be level 20, they no longer receive additional HP or bonus points, and are considered to be at their most powerful, having met their potential. Whatever this means to your character or your group is up to you. The character might rule a kingdom, mentor a new generation of adventurers, or maybe their feats have attracted the attention of some higher entity who either challenges them, rewards them, or teleports them to a new realm where they enter a whole new level of challenge and start fresh on the progression track, losing the benefits of their old life. Get creative!
