Villain passes psychosis with a kiss??????????

Body issues, buck teeth and pear shape and body hair, proud of her body but not at the same time

Adrien Fox starts out as a cop but gets caught up in a police brutality scandal for whistleblowing on an abusive coworker that murdered a suspect in cold blood. This spirals into him being abused at work and eventually quitting the force right before he's set up by the other cops for a major crime.

Sorrel the bard plays a keytar (most annoying instrument)

legs morph in a wheel to move???

Oberon Electronics

Sorrel's parents have distanced themselves from the fae and magic. They instead have tried to assimilate into human society, leaving the fae without leadership. In the power vacuum, different factions have risen to try and usurp the throne, but per Ancient Law, unless the bloodline of Oberon is destroyed, no new king can be crowned.

Sorrel's parents don't want her to continue the royal line either, and in fact want all fae to eventually assimilate as well.
