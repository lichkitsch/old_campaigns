# Script for dnduet System Explanation episode

Hail and well met, listener! This episode of dnduet is an introduction to the custom RPG system I've "frankensteined" together for this podcast. My name is Acorn and you're listening to dnduet.

Alright, so I wanted to spend a little bit of time to explain the basic rules and mechanics of dnduet, the game, so that you can follow what's happening during our campaign. This is a game that's been in the making under various names for many years now, as I'm constantly second-guessing myself and unwilling to leave well-enough alone. I'm also not going to pretend that I'm doing anything original here; the basis for most tabletop games is largely the same. The moderator describes the scene, the player does something and, if there's a chance of failure, rolls some dice against a target number. Simple. That's the minimum you have to know to follow along, and if you're satisfied with that you can jump in with our first episode. On the other hand, if you want the details so you can play dnduet yourself, stay with me for the next few minutes.

To play dnduet you need a moderator (sometimes called a dungeon master or DM), one or more players, and a dice set. You'll need a d20, d12, d8, d6, and d4. You can also use the dice roller on our website, but it's totally worth it to go out and get some polyhedral dice from your local game shop or online.
