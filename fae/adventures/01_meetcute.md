# Meet Cute

## Entrance & Guardian
Open with a bang: Sorrel is called in to the ring for her fight against a young, gruff satyr named Thorn.

### Thorn the L1 Satyr
AF 10 / HP 10 / S+2 D+1 V+0 I-2 W-2 C+0
Thorn fights with his fists wrapped in tape. He has a gold tooth, a broken nose, and his horns have been shaved down.

After the fight, Sorrel sees on her phone that she has 2 missed calls and a text from her father that says "Come home, now."

## Minor Challenge
Before she can leave the Sprawl, Sorrel is approached by Hemlock and his cronies/guards, Oyster and Beech. He either teases her for losing or claims that Thorn went easy since she's a princess, then claims that Sorrel owes him the fee for fighting in the Sprawl.

Note: Hemlock is NOT in charge of the Sprawl and has no business asking anyone for money. Sorrel has been forbidden from touching Hemlock (when a child of either court reaches the age when they can walk, they are subject to a spell that prevents them from physically interacting with the members of the opposite family), but that doesn't mean that his cronies have to follow the same rules. Sorrel can pay him and get teased again, fight his cronies, or run away and start a chase sequence.

### Oyster the L1 Ruffian
AF 12 / HP 10 / S+1 D+2 V+0 I-2 W-1 C-1
Oyster is a brute with a bat and a bandage on his cheek. Mushrooms are popping out of his head and he has beady, black eyes.

### Beech the L1 Stonespeaker
AF 12 / HP 10 / S+2 D+1 V+0 I-1 W-2 C+1
Beech is a thin, pale wisp of a girl with elongated features and sharp teeth.

Sorrel gets arrested by Fox.

## Plot Twist
On their way to the station, Fox's car is slammed into by a truck. The car has been flipped and the two can pull themselves from the wreckage with some effort. They can then see the truck that hit them... the back has been torn open by something big and there are three mean-looking human men arguing with each other and brandishing weapons. When they sense Sorrel and Fox have exited the wrecked car, one says "Great, now there's witnesses." and the three aim their weapons and start towards them.

## Major Challenge
The gangsters say "Don't worry, we'll be quick."

### L2 Smuggler Driver
AF 14 / HP 15 / S+2 D-1 V+2 I+0 W-1 C-1
The biggest of the humans has a burn on his face and is holding an old-looking rifle like a bat.

### L1 Smuggler (x2)
AF 14 / HP  9 / S+1 D+1 V-1 I-2 W-1 C+0
The other two smugglers (a short one with a knife and a bald one with a crowbar).

## Reward/Revelation
King Alder thanks Fox for escorting Sorrel home safely and Maple reveals that Fox is to be her personal bodyguard. She cashed in a favor with his Captain and Fox is to stick close to Sorrel and keep her out of trouble (as best he can). Fox isn't particularly excited by this.
