# Untitled Episode 2
- What was in the smuggler's van? The prisoners aren't talking and there's no telling what's out there in the city, waiting to cause trouble.
- In the meantime, Fox invites Sorrel out for coffee to get to know her and let her ask him questions as a courtesy.
- The coffee shop happens to also be the one where Fern works.
- Fox orders his usual, a black cold-brew coffee, and will only reveal the following:
    1. He's been a detective for less than a year, and was a patrol officer before that.
    2. He is an orphan.
    3. He finds Sorrel interesting, like there's something different about her.
- He'll try to find out the following:
    1. Sorrel's past, relationship  with parents
    2. Sorrel's schedule, the fighting
    3. What's up with the construction site
- Near the end of their talk, Sorrel gets a text from a blocked number that reads "Watch your step."
- Sorrel gets invited to play at a club opening (Sanguine) for one of Fern's friends, Malva. 
- Fox wants to investigate the smugglers but can't leave Sorrel to her own devices. He offers to let her "shadow" him, if she'll agree to follow his lead.

Sorrel can decide to:
1. Talk to Fox's hacker friend at the station to find out where the text came from.
2. Go help Fern and Malva with setting up the Sanguine launch party.
3. Tag along while Fox investigates the smuggling ring.
