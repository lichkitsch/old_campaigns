# Untitled Episode 2
- What was in the smuggler's van? The prisoners aren't talking and there's no telling what's out there in the city, waiting to cause trouble.
- In the meantime, Fox invites Sorrel out for coffee to get to know her and let her ask him questions as a courtesy.
- The coffee shop happens to also be the one where Fern works.
- Fox orders his usual, a black cold-brew coffee, and will only reveal the following:
    1. He's been a detective for less than a year, and was a patrol officer before that.
    2. He is an orphan.
    3. He finds Sorrel interesting, like there's something different about her.
- He'll try to find out the following:
    1. Sorrel's past, relationship  with parents
    2. Sorrel's schedule, the fighting
    3. What's up with the construction site
- Near the end of their talk, Sorrel gets a text from a blocked number that reads "Watch your step."
- Sorrel gets invited to play at a club opening (Sanguine) for one of Fern's friends, Malva. 
- Fox wants to investigate the smugglers but can't leave Sorrel to her own devices. He offers to let her "shadow" him, if she'll agree to follow his lead.
