## The Library
The Paragon City Public Library is a huge institute that doubles as one part library, one part university, and one part museum. Huge marble columns and stone lions guard the front entrance, adorned with a plaque thanking those who donated funds to the library. At the top of the list sits the Dananns and the Blackwoods.

Behind the front desk sits JACOB, a Navigator who guides fae to the entrance of the faerie library in Nogarap.

In transit to the library, SORREL is unknowingly redirected by UL'ITH, a daemon pretending to be JACOB. SORREL finds herself in a strange sandy pit surrounded by ancient stone walls covered in thorny vines. UL'ITH instructs SORREL that to earn her library card she first has to pass a test. A babydoll falls from the darkness above and lands in the sand. Moments later, there is a grinding noise as one of the walls opens up to reveal a huge boar with ruby tusks, which charges towards SORREL.

RUBOAR: 20HP / B+3 M-2 H-2 S+1 / The ruby tusks are fragile and will burst if the boar crashes into a wall

After defeating the boar, the floor rumbles and cracks, the sand leaking down through the cracks in the rock which gives way to a bubbling lava pit far below, which the body of the boar sinks into. On the far side of the arena a door appears, but the floor is fading fast.

LAVA PIT: DEX skill checks to avoid falling.
    On a failure the floor sinks further and SORREL must roll STR to pull herself back up.
    On a failed STR save, SORREL falls into the lava, but as she makes contact the lava turns into sand again. 
    If this happens, SORREL must find a way to climb up out of the pit to get to the door.

On the other side of the door is a luxe hotel room with french doors that open to a balcony, overlooking a bubbling sea of lava. UL'ITH sits at a vanity, putting makeup on her face, which looks like JACOB. UL'ITH is a vain trickster daemon who is putting on a voice to sound like JACOB.

UL'ITH: 30HP / B-1 M+2 H+2 S-2

In the midst of battle, a portal will open with FERN and the real JACOB stepping out to retrieve SORREL.

Back at the library, all SORREL needs to get her library card is to fill out a simple form and have her picture taken. After gaining access to the library, it's time to go and see ???

The club is built on the gutted remains of the old Sanford theatre. The "San" part of the sign was kept, the rest of the letters were built in graffiti style out of neon tubes. It's a large brick building with a box-office style front and an alley around the back.

Malva
Fern
Ash
Fennel
Beech is also at the launch, but Sorrel doesn't notice until she's up on stage

Several of the Thornfrosts show up to the launch, selling sweetspark (an upper) to the crowd and trying to extort Malva to make up for their loss

Some of the fae have an immediate reaction to the Thornfrost drugs and try to attack Sorrel and Fennel backstage

Sweetsparker: 10HP/B+2/M-2/H-1/S+0
