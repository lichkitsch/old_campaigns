## Review
Sorrel got her library card after an unintended detour to Astrid's cell and got an address for the spot on the map, which lies deep in Blackwood territory. To make it to the club launch in time, the girls have to travel through the Twilight Realm and pick up Fox.

- Fire drake on the loose
