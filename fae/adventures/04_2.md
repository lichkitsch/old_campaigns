## Obstacles
### Library Card
SORREL needs a library card to access the Nogarap Library.
- Pit of Sorrow Puzzle: A ceramic baby doll is dropped from the darkness above. It has three slots on it's chest. On one of the walls, written in Faespeak, there's a clue: "Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire?" The doll has an emerald and a sapphire in two of the slots already. Reaching towards the word for ruby reveals a small hole with a button which sets off a trap: the hole shrinks around the victim's hand and a boar with ruby tusks is let loose into the pit.
- The Ruboar: 20 HP / B+3 M-2 H-2 S+1 / The Ruboar has a ruby tongue piercing which needs to be removed and slotted into the doll to progress.
