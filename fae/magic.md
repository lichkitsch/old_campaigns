Magic gave birth to the first spirits. These original sprites were curious, envious creatures who found great joy in using magic to mimic the world around them. The first spirits took the forms of the elements of nature, and as life formed, the spirits had more and more forms to mimic. Their mimicry wasn't perfect, however, and even those with strong ties to magic ended up with uncanny resemblances. As humans evolved, the spirits mimicked them as well, though the majority kept to nature and stayed far away from these odd, upright apes.

Humans had some contact with the spirits and they became the source for many stories and rumors. As the stories twisted and changed and made their way back to the spirits, the spirits started to mimic these fictional forms as well, though they had become lost in translation. The humans gave the spirits many names, though for sake of simplicity we shall refer to them as faeries, or the Fey.

The first human to use magic was married to a faery. She made a rudimentary record of the Fey language, used to commune with the spirits of nature, and found that by speaking or writing in fey-speak, she too could use magic. This first caster, referred to in records as Caster Prime, took the secret origin of the access to magic to her grave. Her notes were collected, copied, and spread throughout the world and eventually all of humanity had a basic, entry-level access to magic.

After this nescient act, the Fey turned to the elder spirits, who in turn communed with magic itself. After some persuading, the weave of magic was convinced that it's children needed protection, and transformed itself into a place set-aside, a dimension which existed adjacent to the realm of man. The Fey could find the gateways to and from this realm, the Twilight Realm, but humans could not.

Mankind continued to develop their grasp on magic, but they had only a handful of symbols and commands to work with and used technology to increase the potency of this strange, supernatural energy. Eventually a mage accidentally discovered the fey-speak symbol for "No" which effectively doubled the number of spells humans could cast.

Faeries can use magic within their domain at will:
Fire / Earth / Water / Air / Life / Light / Space / Time / Sense

Humans can only access these basic spells, but apply them liberally to their buildings, tools, and weapons:
Push   / Pull    : Used for moving objects
Harm   / Heal    : Used for inflicting and healing injuries
Speak  / Silence : Used for telepathy
See    / Blind   : Used for scrying
Listen / Deafen  : Used for spying
Slow   / Quicken : Used for adjusting the flow of time for a specific object
Lock   / Unlock  : Used for securing spaces
Frenzy / Calm    : Used for terrorism and crowd control

Even with the semblance of control that both humans and faeries share regarding magic, it's a chaotic, unpredictable essence that can easily bite back at it's user if improperly handled.
