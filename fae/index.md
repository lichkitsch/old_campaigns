## Fox
Detective Adrien Fox was born to Castor and Achillea, but was switched at birth with a human child (a changeling) who was named Hemlock and raised as the prince in his place. Fox moved from foster home to foster home until he could emancipate himself and became a cop after a couple of close calls with the law. Fox is curious about Sorrel and wants to know more about her. Specifically, he wants to know more about her brass knuckles and the obvious lies regarding her presence at the construction site. Fox and Red were investigating a string of thefts throughout the city, which has now turned into an investigation of the smugglers they crashed into and fought. In the long run, Fox has a main goal of finding out who his parents are.

## Fern
Fern is an autumn fern nymph and Sorrel's most recent ex. They very nearly got married, but Fern needed Sorrel to show she could become more mature and, after a drawn out fight, they broke up. Fern is still friends with Sorrel and they still get along, they just have a mutual understanding that they might not have made the best of spouses for each other. She works as a medic in the Sprawl by night and a barista at the Copper Cup by day, getting little sleep and butting into Sorrel's affairs more than she rightly should.

## Dahlia Richards
Dahlia is a salamander coming to Paragon City from a trip through time. Originally she was a fire spirit living with her dragon husband in the year 1102 when she met Belvedere and started her journey through the ages. She amassed great wealth and power and is now looking to use that power to take her place in the royal line. Dahlia hopes to accomplish this by pinpointing the weakest link in the royal chain and replacing it.

## King Alder
Alder recently received a text message with a photo attachment, which included a threat of revealing their true nature and a meeting place in three day's time. Between this and the fight Sorrel had with Hemlock's bodyguards, along with trying to impress the Richards, Alder is holding interviews with people applying to become Sorrel's personal bodyguard.
