# How to Write an Adventure
Writing compelling adventures is the main responsibility of the game master. This "method" is really just some basic advice for constructing any kind of adventure, making it fast and simple to produce well-paced encounters to challenge, excite, and entertain your players. You don't have to be a great writer to run a fun adventure, but hopefully with some extra thought, creativity, and practice you will be managing entire campaigns that keep your players at the edge of their seats.

## Plot Hook
Create a scenario, or NPC, that introduces a problem that needs fixing. You can and should include multiple hooks in a location so that the party can come across them on their own and have a choice of which hook they want to follow. If they leave before a hook is used, repurpose it later on down the road or twist it so that walking away from the adventure leads to consequences.

**Examples**
- The party comes into a new town with a recent series of strange disappearances.
- The party is falsely accused of a crime and must escape or prove their innocence.
- There's talk of a treasure trove in an abandoned, flooded city not far from here.
- One of the party members is kidnapped in the dead of night and must be rescued.
- A relative of a party member shows up asking for help to pay off a debt.

## Guardian at the Gate
There's one big obstacle that's kept the problem from being solved thus far, an obstacle that your party must overcome to even start the adventure. This could be a literal guardian posted at the dungeon's entrance, but often times you want to be a little more metaphorical.

**Examples**
- The cave entrance is littered with bones and blocked by a large, sleeping troll.
- The college only allows entry to students and faculty, a rule enforced by a dangerous magical barrier.
- The NPC from the story hook is murdered and the mystery surrounding their death acts as the first obstacle.
- The island on which the treasure is located is difficult to find because it changes locations.
- The party must gain the favor of an animalistic deity before gaining entry to its forest.

## The Minor Challenge
Once the party is past the "gate" and into the meat of the adventure, they immediately face their first challenge. Challenges should focus on one of the three pillars of adventure RPGs: exploration, social interaction, and combat.

### Clues, Puzzles, and Traps
Exploration encounters will involve collecting information from the environment and solving puzzles or traps that keep the party from progressing.

**Examples**
- Several clues lead the party to a secret door behind a heavy wardrobe.
- The next room is closed off by a seemingly sentient door that speaks in riddles and is protected by magic.
- The party enters a chamber with an ornate box on a pedastal labelled "Caution: Rats". It is filled with rats.
- The party finds a poem engraved in stone that must be deciphered, but doing so teleports them somplace else.

### Wits and Wiles
Design NPCs with a few basic characteristics and what information they have that the player's do not, but also give them a rating on whether they are *forthcoming*, *helpful*, and *suspiscious*.

**Examples**
- The party must convince the rebel leader to show them the secret entrance to the tyrant's keep.
- Once they've gained access to the fancy gala, the party must chat it up with nobles for clues.
- A hermit outside of town needs your help to warn the king of a coming danger that he saw in a vision.
- Interviewing the palace servants helps piece together the timeline of events and a secret love triangle.

### Hostile Engagement
Sometimes the party will come across creatures or NPCs that stand in their way in a literal fashion, claws and blades and arrows at the ready. The party should have multiple options for dealing with the danger such as stealth, negotiation, or intimidation, and combat should be employed only when absolutely necessary.

**Examples**
- The prince is stuck in a cage and guarded by a troop of gnoll fighters.
- The tunnels are filled with rats, acidic slimes, and wandering monsters that threaten the party.
- Only after entering the monastery does the party realize it's filled to the brim with vampires.
- While traversing from the entrance of the wood to the center, the party is attacked by bar-bear-ians.

## Red Herring
The third major event of the adventure is the twist, the setback, or the red herring. Either the problem isn't what the party thought it was, the clear path to the goal is obscured or destroyed and the party must find another path to take, or the conclusion they came to based on the clues they gathered was wrong and they must sort out the false information before they can continue.

**Examples**
- The treasure in the vault isn't a small chest or a bag of coins, but a massive, sparkling, 500lb. diamond.
- The ghost of the baron's wife was actually his nephew playing a tasteless prank. So who really killed the baron?
- The maze that the party has been navigating looped around in a big circle, bringing them back to the entrance.
- The tip from the captured goblin chief was a lie that leads the party straight into an ambush.

## The Major Challenge
The second to last scene is the major challenge. This is the big climax, the moment the dramatic question is answered, the true test of your party's abilities. These are most often combat-based, but not always.

**Examples**
- The dragon's awake and out for blood, claws and teeth and flames ready to tear the party to pieces.
- The party enters the ritual sacrifice chamber to find the cult leader seconds away from killing an innocent.
- The summoned kraken appears and begins to wrap it's massive tentacles around the body of the ship.
- The mad wizard could see the party's movements and had time to call upon reinforcements.

## Reward and Revelation
The final scene reveals something to the party as a reward for overcoming the climax. This could be treasure, reputation, relationships, titles, etc. The party might also find that the reward they expected is not there, and in its place there is a new story hook that leads into the next adventure.

**Examples**
- The evil archduke is revealed to be the father of one of the player characters.
- The townspeople knew about the serial killer and did nothing, as the killer only targeted orcs.
- The haunted mansion was actually an extravagent magical illusion by an old bard who is willing to teach you the spell.
- The castle was built to protect against a greater evil, and the dying sorcerer was the only thing holding it back.
