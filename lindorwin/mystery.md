# Making a Mystery

## Determine the Crime
Who did what to who, when, where, and why? The guilty needs means, motive, and opportunity.

## Clues to Conclusions
Means, motive, and opportunity must be revealed before the guilty party can be reasonably detained.

### The Three Clue Rule
For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues.

## Red Herrings
Suspects might have means, motive, or opportunity but not all three. People lie. Some clues aren't related to the crime. Sprinkle in doubt and dead ends.

## Deliver the Clues
Let your players come to conclusions on their own; your only job is to relay the facts of the case as they are uncovered in an intriguing way and keep track of what is known and what is not.
