# Snow Day

## Prologue
Queen Mira sends the party far north of Steson to the lumber village of White Vale, a once sleepy town on the edge of a large evergreen forest. The villagers slowly vanished without a trace, and the scouting party sent to investigate never returned. The road north is somewhat treacherous itself, ice and bandits making travel difficult.

### Goal
Investigate the disappearances and (if possible) return with the scouting party.

Little more than a campsite, White Vale sits at the edge of a large evergreen forest. Woodsfolk comb the forest for timber to process into lumber and ship to Steson. The whole affair has been developed to be sustainable; trees are cultivated along the edge of the forest with the deeper "main" woods left untouched, taking advantage of the ecosystem without disturbing the land too much. The brick buildings stand silent in the snow, pathways left unshoveled and campfires long dead. The snow falls slowly and there are no footprints to be seen. There are six buildings total, each with a wooden sign indicating its purpose. There doesn't seem to be any sign of a struggle.
