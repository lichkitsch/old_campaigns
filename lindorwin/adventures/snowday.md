# Snow Day

## Prologue
Queen Mira's good friend Ilien, head foreman of the lumber processing camp at White Vale, has gone missing and she wants Ifir's help in locating her. The road north is somewhat treacherous itself, ice and bandits making travel difficult.

### Goal
Find out what happened to Ilien and report back to Queen Mira.

## The Truth
Ilien was attacked in the middle of the night some weeks ago by a strange creature resembling a yeti. She managed to kill the creature, but not before taking a few injuries herself. Disoriented by the attack, she wandered into the deeper woods where she retreated to a dwarf mine that had been abandoned long ago. Ilien became trapped (but hidden) when a faction of pale dwarves set up camp in the mine and started planning an attack on White Vale to hold it for ransom. 

### Conclusions
1. Ilien was attacked by a now-dead yeti creature.
    - Blood on the trees is found soon after the party arrives.
    - Ilien's necklace found near the blood.
    - Body of the yeti can be discovered in the forest, gutted.
2. Ilien is hiding in the abandoned mine.
    - Bloody handprints on the trees lead further into the forest.
    - The Woodsfolk know of the mine as a rumor.
    - The blizzard leads them deeper into the forest. 
3. Ilien is also a runaway angel and Ezrah was sent to retrieve her.
    - Ezrah is involved.
    - Ilien's blood shines strangely in the moonlight.
    - Ilien is found with her wings out.

**Note:** This is not a mystery, this is a pretty straight-forward track and rescue mission.

Little more than a campsite, White Vale sits at the edge of a large evergreen forest around the base of a large mountain range, beyond which is a frozen wasteland called the Lonely Plains. Woodsfolk comb the forest for timber to process into lumber and ship to Steson. The whole affair has been developed to be sustainable; trees are cultivated along the edge of the forest with the deeper "main" woods left untouched, taking advantage of the ecosystem without disturbing the land too much. There are six buildings total, each with a wooden sign indicating its purpose. Woodsfolk sit outside around campfires. They've been searching the forest in shifts, looking for Ilien but finding nothing.
