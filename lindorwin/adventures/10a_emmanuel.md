## Help Emmanuel
### Hook
Visit Emmanuel at the Library, see his collection, receive the quest, and a secret that will help Ifir.

### Gateway
Head to the Maison du Souvenir to speak with Armand's brother, Louis. (Twist, the funeral is in progress when Ifir arrives) Ifir is invited to celebrate Armand's life with them. Louis doesn't want Armand's skull to be held by the Library because he disagrees with an alchemical theorem that Armand wrote, stating that slime creatures were made up of mostly water, where Louis' theory involves slime being mostly made up of dangerous acidic compounds. He's petty, and thinks that by letting Armand continue to teach that he might teach the "wrong things" to people.

*Maison du Souvenir*
- Cut stone walls, marble pillars, wooden doors, stained glass windows
- Stale air mixed with the gentle, sweet smell of flowers
- Muffled sounds of a crowd beyond the doors
- Tapestries and painted portraits adorn the walls
- Crowd of mourners waiting inside, dressed in black clothing, some crying most not

A. Quiet Alcove, stairs lead down into crypts
B. Main area, flowers and people everywhere
C. Open casket with Armand's body inside
D. Another quiet alcove, stairs to crypts

### Trial
Whispers lead Ifir to a dark corner where she is confronted by the ghost of the Alchemist himself. Armand doubles down on his agreement in his will that stipulates his skull is to be interred at the Library, saying that Louis is a fool and is just being petty, and that Ifir should bring Louis to him here and let Armand convince him (as to not alert the guests).

### Twist
As Ifir returns to the main area, Armand's body is being possessed by the ghost of his old rival, a sorcerer named Corbeau. Corbeau is pissed at Armand for killing him. (His illness came from him ingesting slime, thinking it was safe after reading Armand's notes on the creatures).

### Climax
The doors seal shut and Corbeau uses fire magic to try and bring the building down. Armand can enter his body and distract Corbeau while Ifir helps by either breaking the body, trapping Corbeau, or putting out the fires. The whole time, Louis is being very "I told you so!" about the whole slime incident that killed Corbeau in the first place.

### Reward
Armand thanks Ifir for her help once Corbeau is defeated. He explains that his notes clearly state that, although slimes *are* mostly water, many harmful potions and poisons are also mostly water and that doesn't make them safe to consume. He gets a little uppity about it but will agree to amend his notes to more clearly state the danger.

Upon returning to the Library with the alchemist's skull, Emmanuel reveals that he has met Anabushka and that she's been attempting to find Ifir, but that she wasn't in the city. He can call upon her and Anabushka can explain to Ifir that she knows a way to get to the moon and rescue Polaris, but the spell will take time to prepare, and it can only carry four people (herself included, for the return spell).











After working the first day, jobs change. Vela ends up in the hospital, training under Sal, and Ilien takes her place as a scribe in the library. Ezrah moves up to operating the crane and is quite happy with the development.

Maybe Polaris puts up a fight? The helm might have some will of its own.

Polaris is going to be unresponsive once the helm is removed; her overflowing anger and pain pushed her to her limit and she needs a well-deserved break.
