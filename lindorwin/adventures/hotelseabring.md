# A Night at Hotel Seabring
After saving Horace Seabring from the kidnapping cult the party is invited to spend a free night at his hotel, the Hotel Seabring. The hotel sits a few miles north of Steson at the edge of a small evergreen forest. It’s a popular spot for hunters, but every year they experience a dry season thanks to rumors of ghosts that appear once a year, always accompanied by a tragic death on the grounds.

The hotel looks like a mansion: four stories of dark red brick, bright white window panes and curtains, black tile roof and gravel roads leading to the patio at the front. There’s a large apple tree out front and a bronze statue of Malta, bow-wielding goddess of the hunt. It’s still spring, and the apple tree is in bloom, filling the wind and lawn with soft pink petals.

The party gets settled in their rooms and they kill time before dinner in their own ways: Salgrim reads a book by the apple tree, Lili and Ningal fish at the small pond next to the hotel, and the Gnolls decide to roam the woods for a few hours.

At dinner Horace explains the dry season, the ghost stories, and the tragic deaths. “It’s always around this time of year, which is why our guests tend to stay away until summer.” He goes on to describe the individual ghosts. “There’s a couple, a prank-pulling pair of star-crossed lovers. A bard, heard singing songs of old and playing some sort of string instrument. The runaway bride, often seen crying on the bench out front in her wedding garments. There are other things people claim to see or feel, cold spots and mood swings and such, but those four are the only ones that have been consistent.” When asked if he has seen them, Horace replies “No, not once, and I’ve lived here my whole life.”

When the party goes to sleep is when things get weird.

First, Ifir wakes up to a pair of glowing eyes watching her. She feels a flush of heat inside her body and a pulsing between her legs. She feels compelled to touch herself and must roll to resist.

Dama shows up with a candleabra and a story about the ghost of a man undressing in his room. Ifir feels a pinch on her butt and turns to see a second Dama, smiling slyly.

Exhausted but unable to sleep, Ifir goes to explore the mansion. She finds Horace dead on the steps of the patio, fang marks in his neck with black veins spreading from the wounds. His body is also contorted into a strange, frozen pose. She goes to wake the rest of the party and tell them what she's found, although Lala is missing. When they return to view the body it's disappeared.

## The Crime
The ghosts wake once a year and call the attention of a reaper, come to ferry their souls to the Pale. Each not wanting to leave for their own reasons (scared of being separated, waiting for her fiance to arrive, unfinished business), the ghosts found ways to avoid the reaper. Heinrich sets traps, the lovers distract folks, Lisabeth latches on to depressed living souls to distract the reaper, and Vavi changes into animals to kill people (the fresh soul takes priority and the reaper spends time taking care of them while the ghosts hide). Come morning they all fade, safe from retribution until the next year. Horace was the victim this year; Vavi made it look like Lala poisoned him to cause a distraction.

## The Investigation
When the party reenters the hotel, the doors slam shut behind them and won't budge. A fog slowly rolls in from down the hallway and fills the room, blocking everyone's vision. While in the cloud, Ifir feels soft hands on her shoulders that spin her and she feels a kiss on her lips but sees nothing. Her vision goes dark. When everyone wakes, they're in different rooms of the hotel and ifir and lili have switched bodies.

### Top floor - Library
Horny gnolls, ifir in lili's body

### Basement
Room full of mirrors from which dark tentacles spring forth and eventually also Heinrich, lili in ifir's body

### Woods
Salgrim wakes in the woods behind the hotel and is chased by a smoke-like being (Annabushka)

Body-switching Kiss - Ifir & Lili (Ifir & gnolls)
Room of Shadow Tentacles - Lili (in Ifir’s body)
