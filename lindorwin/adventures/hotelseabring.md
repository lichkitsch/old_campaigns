# Haunted Hotel Horny Murder Mystery

After the stress of the last adventure the party decides to spend the night in a swanky hotel, courtesy of the owner Horace Seabring, the older man they saved from the cultists. The massive 4 story hotel was the first in the city to have electric lamps installed throughout it's entirety, and it's fancy decor belies the haunted nature of the building itself. As busy as the hotel is, they suffer a dry season during the month of leaves thanks to a ghost story tied to the land it was built on, a hill just a few miles north of Steson. The party doesn't learn of this story until dinner, seeing that the hotel itself lacks guests and the servants are uncomfortable sticking around.

During dinner Horace regales the story of the ghosts that supposedly haunt the manor: a pair of starcrossed lovers, a runaway bride, a handsome bard, and a strange apparition.

At the end of his story the lights cut out and when they turn back on, Horace has gone missing, a note left in his chair pinned by an odd-looking knife that reads "he shall repent."
