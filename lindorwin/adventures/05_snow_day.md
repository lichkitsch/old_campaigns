# Snow Day

## Act One
Castle Spellsong, Spring

Queen Mira's good friend Ilien, head foreman of the lumber processing camp at White Vale, has gone missing and she wants Ifir's help in locating her. The road north is somewhat treacherous itself, ice and bandits making travel difficult.

### The Question
Will the party recover Ilien alive and safe?

## Act Two
White Vale

Little more than a campsite, White Vale sits at the edge of a large evergreen forest around the base of a large mountain range, beyond which is a frozen wasteland called the Lonely Plains. Woodsfolk comb the forest for timber to process into lumber and ship to Steson. The whole affair has been developed to be sustainable; trees are cultivated along the edge of the forest with the deeper "main" woods left untouched, taking advantage of the ecosystem without disturbing the land too much. There are six buildings total, each with a wooden sign indicating its purpose. Woodsfolk sit outside around campfires. They've been searching the forest in shifts, looking for Ilien but finding nothing.

The party can find the following clues:
1. Ezrah rooting through papers in the office.
4. Strange noises in the woods at night.
5. White hair in the washroom.
6. Blood on the trees a little deeper into the woods.

### Encounter 1 - The Mairu
While searching for Ilien, the party comes across a yeti-like monster roaming the woods, it's maw caked in blood.

**Legend**
1. The Mairu (AC 14 | 24 HP | Claws [2d4 dmg])

After defeating the Mairu, a blizzard is brought on that separates the party. Ifir and Ezrah find shelter in an empty cave.

### The Twist
Ifir and Ezrah watch as the rest of the party, captured by a troop of dwarves, are being led to an abandoned mine.

### Encounter 2 - Mine Entrance
The party is being held at the mine's entrance by a few dwarves, the rest of the dwarven troop is unseen.
