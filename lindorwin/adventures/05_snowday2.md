# Snow Day

## Setup
Queen Mira's good friend Ilien, head foreman of the lumber processing camp at White Vale, has gone missing and she wants Ifir's help in locating her. The road north is somewhat treacherous itself, ice and bandits making travel difficult.

### The Goal
Investigate Ilien's disappearance and, if possible, rescue her

## Encounter 1 - Puzzle/RP Challenge
Little more than a campsite, White Vale sits at the edge of a large evergreen forest around the base of a large mountain range, beyond which is a frozen wasteland called the Lonely Plains. Woodsfolk comb the forest for timber to process into lumber and ship to Steson. The whole affair has been developed to be sustainable; trees are cultivated along the edge of the forest with the deeper "main" woods left untouched, taking advantage of the ecosystem without disturbing the land too much. There are six buildings total, each with a wooden sign indicating its purpose. Woodsfolk sit outside around campfires. They've been searching the forest in shifts, looking for Ilien but finding nothing.

Strangely, Ezrah is found rooting through papers in the office. He's very secretive about why he is there and won't say more than "I was also sent to recover Ilien. She is important."

Search the thorp and look for clues that the woodsfolk might have missed, piece together a timeline.

**Stopping Point**
Dama just said "Well, if you can get my name wrong..." and sat with the lumberjacks at the campfire.
**Stopping Point**

1. Poli, the cook, saw Ilien heading into the woods four nights ago with a bow and quiver of arrows in hand. She was leaving from the washroom, which she thought was odd. Poli didn't have time to tell anyone what she saw, as she left to see family in the city and only just got back.
2. There are odd white hairs in the washroom that don't match anyone's hair in the village. Ilien's hair is blonde.
3. Deeper into the forest there is bloody handprint found on a tree, another not far past it. Following the bloody prints leads the party to a clearing where a large white-haired beast sleeps, two arrows jutting out from it's back. The beast blends in with the snow and is easily woken.

## Encounter 2 - Entrance with Guardian
The Mairu wakes and attacks the party with a bloodthirsty rage.

The Mairu: AC 14 | 12 /32 HP | claws 2d4

## Encounter 3 - Trick/Setback
Killing the Mairu triggers a freak blizzard that sweeps in over the forest, winds blasting through and rocking the trees. The party finds safety in an empty cave, tunnels making for walled off rooms. The blizard rages on outside while Ezrah and Ifir share a night together.

Waking in the morning, they find that they have been trapped in by a rockslide of some sort. After escaping the cave, the two realize that the party is missing, a jumble of footprints leading off into the woods. The weather is calm and there's no snowfall, so the prints are fresh (for now).

**Stopping Point**
Ifir snuck back out of the mine's entrance to reconvene with Ezrah
**Stopping Point**

## Encounter 4 - Climax
The party is being held at the mine's entrance by a few dwarves, the rest of the dwarven troop is unseen.
