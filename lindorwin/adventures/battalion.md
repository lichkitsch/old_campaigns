# Battalion

## Exploration
Lili has run away, confused and disillusioned by her first indirect contact with her deity. She left a note which the gnolls found and bring to Ifir that reads "God is an asshole??? Gone to sort this out." The gnolls, worried about Lili, leave the city in pursuit in hopes of bringing her back.

Ezrah is on the mend but is human now. He's lost his tether to the Light and his magic is gone. While he misses it and the pain is unbearable some days, Ezrah stays positive and works hard at physical therapy.

Dama has quit his job as a guard (a position he held for exactly one week) and has taken to gambling and hustling pirates down by the docks. He swears he's not into anything too dangerous, but he's come home bloody from a fight more than once.

Salgrim has retreated into her room at the Willywock, barely leaving for days at a time. She doesn't say much and takes her meals back to her room, but when pressed she simply responds with "I'm getting so close..."

True to his word, Elduin sends a battalion of angels to Steson. After a long journey from the other side of the continent, 500 angels arrive in the city. They set up outposts, curfews, and patrols to search for the Silence, the cult that made the attempt on Mira's life and kidnapped Elomar. The battalion is led by Lieutenant Colonel Ursa, a thin ghost of a woman with a rapier at her side and a cold, gray stare. She butts heads with Captain Sophia but is quick to take command of the city, by Elduin's orders of course. A team of four angels are assigned to Ifir.

Julius is a stern, apologetic man with a strong brow and a warhammer. Imposing, but a bit shorter than Ezrah.

Carina is cold and mean, but is also Ifir's best bet at learning more about the squad and her father's plan.

The city wasn't prepared to defend itself from 500 well-trained angels and was quickly brought under control by Lieutenant Colonel Ursa. They shut down the docks, and angels fill the streets and castle. Ifir is encouraged to stay indoors, like everyone else, but it's not long before the angels start to overstep their bounds and begin jailing people underneath the castle. Mira has retreated as well, fleeing the city with Elomar, Yuna, and Setra to their island in secret to keep her safe from the Silence.



## Hook
When the angels arrive and sweep the Docks, Dama is arrested and held for questioning. Someone passes her a note that reads "silent key rescue" in thieves' cant.

## Trial 1 - Test of Wiles
To gain entry into the prison, Ifir must convince L.G. Ursa to let her be the one to interrogate the captured members of the Silence. Ifir can learn the following things:

**Both Cultists**
- The blue tiefling's name is Lomund.
- The demon tattooed on his back is the ancient demon emperor Rulomqo'leth.
- The Silence want to bring Rulomqo'leth to this plane.
- The young prince was meant to become a vessel for Rulomqo'leth, but it failed and now he's simply half-demonic.
- Supposedly only one of royal blood can become a vessel for Rulomqo'leth, which is why the Silence were targeting the Spellsongs.

**Half-elf Woman (Crossbow)**
- The Silence were once normal villagers, but their village was destroyed by a sweeping madness.
- From the wreckage, Lomund rose as the leader of the remaining villagers, those who survived the psychosis but came out the other side with a new dark master, the demon emperor Rulomqo'leth.
- The Silence have already left the city, spirited away to someplace secret by Lomund's shadow magic.

**Human Man (Dagger and Magic)**
- Lomund was a gang leader who sold his soul to a devil and was dragged into the Dark when his time was up.
- Lomund survived in the Dark long enough to make a pact with the Children of Shadows for passage back in exchange for his promise to bring Rulomqo'leth to this plane.
- The Silence are leaving the city through the sewers and catacombs.
- Dama is hiding something. (Dama doesn't know about his lineage, will claim that the thing Ifir didn't know was that he was planning to confront his mother again. He wouldn't know what to say but feels like he didn't get the chance to properly chew her out for how she abandoned him.)

## Trial 2 - Test of Wits
After visiting with Dama, Ifir finds out that he's been framed for a murder that happened down by the docks, apparently over a gambling dispute. Dama swears he didn't do it, but there's dried blood on his shirt and he was found wielding a bloody knife. According to Dama, he'd found the victim still alive and was trying to help stop the bleeding to save him. On the other hand, there were witnesses that saw Dama in a heated argument with the victim just half an hour before the murder, during which they claim Dama said "I'll kill you."

When questioned on this, Dama will say that he told the man "I'll bill you." Dama was making a deal with the man, a smuggler, to bring him a special gemstone. Dama was planning to have it cut and set into a silver band for Ifir as a gift when she had the baby, but the shipment was going to be late. Dama didn't want to admit this to the angels, as smuggling is also illegal and they would've ruined the surprise for Ifir. 

L.G. Ursa claims that she'll let Dama go free if Ifir can prove Dama's innocence. At the scene of the crime, a warehouse down at the docks, Ifir can find the following clues:

1. A box of coins hidden in a sack of grain.
2. The coins aren't common, they're dwarvish tower coins: rare and expensive.
3. A hidden map of the Mason's Guild with entryways marked and notes written in the margins.
4. The ripped-up pieces of an unsigned note accusing the victim of theft and threatening them.

Obviously the victim pulled a heist on the Mason's Guild and stole a box of rare dwarvish tower coins from the guildmaster, who had since gone missing and is assumed to have fled the city.

## Twist/Setback
Someone on the team told Dama that Ifir worked for Elduin as a spy. Dama says "I can understand why you didn't tell me." but instead Ifir hears "Why didn't you tell me?" Elduin's influence on Ifir's senses is growing stronger. At Dama's trial, Ifir is given the opportunity to present the evidence and lay out the events for the acting judge L.G. Ursa. What Ifir doesn't know is that Dama wasn't arrested for the murder, which the angels already solved and arrested the Mason's guildmaster before he could leave the city. Dama was arrested for raising his sword to Elduin. L.G. Ursa calls for Dama's execution.

## Climax


## Revelation
Why are the Silence after the royal family? To replace them? They clearly want to summon their demonic deity.

Ancient Demon Emperor Rulomqo'leth (Devourer) (looks like an oni, large fangs and pointed ears)
Rul? As in Dama's father Rul? Is the demon emperor related to Dama? Dama has no magic, maybe the demon emperor is weak against magic? Maybe that's why Rul was transformed into the Scaled One? His mother is clearly magical, but wasn't until the deal with a devil. Also who was the devil she made a deal with? Maybe the devil knew that bringing Rul back in his original form wasn't possible?
