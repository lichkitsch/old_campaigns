# Battalion
Lili has run away, confused and disillusioned by her first indirect contact with her deity. She left a note which the gnolls found and bring to Ifir that reads "God is an asshole??? Gone to sort this out." The gnolls, worried about Lili, leave the city in pursuit in hopes of bringing her back.

Ezrah is on the mend but is human now. He's lost his tether to the Light and his magic is gone. While he misses it and the pain is unbearable some days, Ezrah stays positive and works hard at physical therapy.

Dama has quit his job as a guard (a position he held for exactly one week) and has taken to gambling and hustling pirates down by the docks. He swears he's not into anything too dangerous, but he's come home bloody from a fight more than once.

Salgrim has retreated into her room at the Willywock, barely leaving for days at a time. She doesn't say much and takes her meals back to her room, but when pressed she simply responds with "I'm getting so close..."

True to his word, Elduin sends a battalion of angels to Steson. After a long journey from the other side of the continent, 500 angels arrive in the city. They set up outposts, curfews, and patrols to search for the Silence, the cult that made the attempt on Mira's life and kidnapped Elomar. The battalion is led by Lieutenant Colonel Ursa, a thin ghost of a woman with a rapier at her side and a cold, gray stare. She butts heads with Captain Sophia but is quick to take command of the city, by Elduin's orders of course. A team of four angels are assigned to Ifir.

**Staff Sargeant Julius**
HP 50 / AC 14
STR +3 / DEX -1 / CON +0 / INT +0 / WIS +1 / CHA +1
Hands +0 / Tools +3 / Magic +0 / Crit +0
Julius is a stern, apologetic man with a strong brow and a warhammer. Imposing, but a bit shorter than Ezrah.

**Corporal Lynx**
HP 40 / AC 11
STR +0 / DEX +2 / CON +2 / INT +1 / WIS -1 / CHA +0
Hands +0 / Tools +1 / Magic -1 / Crit +1
Lynx is a wildcard, a quick DPS fighter with metal claw weapons. Sharp, quick, to the point.

**Officer Cadet Vela**
HP 30 / AC 12
STR +3 / DEX +2 / CON +0 / INT -1 / WIS +0 / CHA -1
Hands +2 / Tools +0 / Magic +1 / Crit +0
Vela is a kind, soft-spoken woman with strong defensive abilities and magic. Fights only when necessary.

**Officer Cadet Carina**
HP 30 / AC 12
STR +3 / DEX +1 / CON +1 / INT +2 / WIS +0 / CHA +0
Hands +1 / Tools -1 / Magic -1 / Crit +1
Carina is cold and mean, but is also Ifir's best bet at learning more about the squad and her father's plan.

The city wasn't prepared to defend itself from 500 well-trained angels and was quickly brought under control by Lieutenant Colonel Ursa. They shut down the docks, and angels fill the streets and castle. Ifir is encouraged to stay indoors, like everyone else, but it's not long before the angels start to overstep their bounds and begin jailing people underneath the castle. Mira has retreated as well, fleeing the city with Elomar to their island in secret to keep her safe from the Silence.
