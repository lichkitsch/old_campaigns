# Battalion
Lili has run away, confused and disillusioned by her first indirect contact with her deity. She left a note which the gnolls found and bring to Ifir that reads "God is an asshole??? Gone to sort this out." The gnolls, worried about Lili, leave the city in pursuit in hopes of bringing her back.

Ezrah is on the mend but is human now. He's lost his tether to the Light and his magic is gone. While he misses it and the pain is unbearable some days, Ezrah stays positive and works hard at physical therapy. Maybe Ifir helps ease his pain late at night when everyone's asleep? (brown chicken, brown cow)

Dama has quit his job as a guard (a position he held for exactly one week) and has taken to gambling and hustling pirates down by the docks. He swears he's not into anything too dangerous, but he's come home bloody from a fight more than once.

Salgrim has retreated into her room at the Willywock, barely leaving for days at a time. She doesn't say much and takes her meals back to her room, but when pressed she simply responds with "I'm getting so close..."

Mama Juniper and Nax go on vacation, leaving Sal with the master key. Sal's tired from her work, but manages to tell Ifir the sex of the baby; it's a girl.

Ifir meant "Leave it" to be about her and not necessarily about Dama.

**Stopping Point**
Knock at the door after seeing angels flying into the city.

## Exploration
True to his word, Elduin sends a battalion of angels to Steson. After a long journey from the other side of the continent, 500 angels arrive in the city. They set up outposts, curfews, and patrols to search for the Silence, the cult that made the attempt on Mira's life and kidnapped Elomar. The battalion is led by Lieutenant Colonel Ursa, a thin ghost of a woman with a rapier at her side and a cold, gray stare. She butts heads with Captain Sophia but is quick to take command of the city, by Elduin's orders of course. A team of four angels are assigned to Ifir.

**Officer Cadet Carina** ❤️30 🛡12  
💪3 🎯1 💊1 📚2 👁0 😎0 🤲1 🛠-1 🔮-1 💯1  
Carina is cold and mean, and while she's knowledgable of Elduin's plans she is a snitch working for Elduin and L.G. Ursa. She's snippy and fights with two javelins. She's tall and willowy and has a smug smile.

The city wasn't prepared to defend itself from 500 well-trained angels and was quickly brought under control by Lieutenant Colonel Ursa. They shut down the docks, and angels fill the streets and castle. Ifir is encouraged to stay indoors, like everyone else, but it's not long before the angels start to overstep their bounds and begin jailing people underneath the castle. Mira has retreated as well, fleeing the city with Elomar, Yuna, and Setra to their island in secret to keep her safe from the Silence.

## Hook
When the angels arrive and sweep the Docks, Dama is arrested and held for questioning. Someone passes her a note that reads "silent key rescue" in thieves' cant.

## Trial 1 - Test of Manners
To gain entry into the prison, Ifir must convince L.G. Ursa to let her be the one to interrogate the captured members of the Silence. Ifir can learn the following things:

**Both Cultists**
Some information is consistent between the two cultists:

- The blue tiefling's name is Lomund.
- The demon tattooed on his back is the ancient demon emperor Rulomqo'leth.
- The Silence want to bring Rulomqo'leth to this plane.
- The young prince was meant to become a vessel for Rulomqo'leth, but it failed and now he's simply half-demonic.
- Supposedly only one of royal blood can become a vessel for Rulomqo'leth, which is why the Silence were targeting the Spellsongs.

**Half-elf Woman (Crossbow)**
Once known as Gerta, the half-elf woman was healed by the castle clerics and given a prosthetic tongue. Though the scars on her face are faded, they'll probably never disappear completely. Gerta is forthcoming, wanting to reduce her sentence, unhelpful as she's still a prisoner, and not suspicious as she's trying to move on and find a new life.

- The other cultist's name used to be Silas.
- The Silence were once normal villagers, but their village was destroyed by a sweeping madness.
- From the wreckage, Lomund rose as the leader of the remaining villagers, those who survived the psychosis but came out the other side with a new dark master, the demon emperor Rulomqo'leth.
- The Silence have already left the city, spirited away to someplace secret by Lomund's shadow magic.

**Human Man (Dagger and Magic)**
The man once known as Silas refused healing and when they tried to give him a prosthetic tongue, he removed it. Silas is not forthcoming, unhelpful, and very suspicious of Ifir and everyone else, and claims Gerta is a filthy traitor, unfit to burn in the belly of the great emperor. 

- Lomund was a gang leader who sold his soul to a devil and was dragged into the Dark when his time was up.
- Lomund survived in the Dark long enough to make a pact with the Children of Shadows for passage back in exchange for his promise to bring Rulomqo'leth to this plane.
- The Silence are leaving the city through the sewers and catacombs.
- Dama is hiding something. (Dama doesn't know about his lineage, will claim that the thing Ifir didn't know was that he was planning to confront his mother again. He wouldn't know what to say but feels like he didn't get the chance to properly chew her out for how she abandoned him.)

While some facts can be tied together, much of what they say cannot be trusted. On her way out, Ifir is slipped a second piece of paper. This one reads "secret friend, bad father".

## Trial 2 - Test of Mind
After talking the team into letting her visit with Dama, Ifir finds out that he's been framed for a murder that happened down by the docks, apparently over a gambling dispute. Dama swears he didn't do it, but there's dried blood on his shirt and he was found wielding a bloody knife. According to Dama, he'd found the victim still alive and was trying to help stop the bleeding to save him. 

L.G. Ursa claims that she'll let Dama go free if Ifir can prove Dama's innocence. At the scene of the crime, a warehouse down at the docks, Ifir can find the following clues:

1. A box of coins hidden in a sack of grain.
2. The coins aren't common, they're dwarvish tower coins: rare and expensive.
3. A hidden map of the Mason's Guild with entryways marked and notes written in the margins.
4. The ripped-up pieces of an unsigned note accusing the victim of theft and threatening them.

Obviously the victim pulled a heist on the Mason's Guild and stole a box of rare dwarvish tower coins from the guildmaster, who had since gone missing and is assumed to have fled the city. On the other hand, there were witnesses that saw Dama in a heated argument with the victim just half an hour before the murder, during which they claim Dama said "I'll kill you."

When questioned on this, Dama will say that he told the man "I'll bill you." Dama was making a deal with the man, a smuggler, to bring him a special gemstone. Dama was planning to have it cut and set into a silver band for Ifir as a gift when she had the baby, but the shipment was going to be late. Dama didn't want to admit this to the angels, as smuggling is also illegal and they would've ruined the surprise for Ifir. 

## Twist/Setback
On her way back to see Dama, Ifir is slipped another piece of paper, this time with a small blue disk included. This note reads "danger bigger, blue safety right time".

## Climax
At Dama's trial, Ifir is given the opportunity to present the evidence and lay out the events for the acting judge L.G. Ursa. What Ifir doesn't know is that Dama wasn't only arrested for the murder. Dama was also arrested for raising his sword to Elduin those few weeks back. 

L.G. Ursa calls for Dama's execution.

When things get bad, the blue portal-coin activates and Vela gives Ifir a wink and a helping hand through the portal before turning to join Julius in holding the angels, including Lynx and Carina, back.

## Revelation
The blue disk is a portal-coin which opens up to the forest outside of White Vale. Ifir, Dama, and Ezrah are met by Anabushka, Ilien, and Polly in the woods, where Ilien explains. She ran away from the Light because she was found out as a traitor. She didn't meet Polly and Ana until after she was already in hiding here in White Vale. According to Ilien there's a growing unrest in the angels, many of whom don't think Elduin is working for good. Anabushka claims to know of a way to defeat Elduin, but that it won't be easy. Ilien seems to believe that Ifir's past as a spy working for Elduin might come in handy for overthrowing him. This alerts Dama, who didn't know she was a spy. Dama says "I can understand why you didn't tell me." but instead Ifir hears "Why didn't you tell me?" Elduin's influence on Ifir's senses is growing stronger.
