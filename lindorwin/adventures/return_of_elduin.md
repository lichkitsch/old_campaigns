# Return of Elduin

Ifir sees bright white light surrounding her. She is in her angelic form, floating in empty space. She hears a familiar voice, like a rumble of thunder from miles away. "You could have told me you were unhappy. I would have let you leave."

Ifir wakes in the middle of the night, terrified. She comes downstairs and finds Salgrim reading in the dining hall while servants rush back and forth in the kitchen. It's the early morning hours of Queen Mira's birthday, a holiday observed by the city of Steson that typically involves the royal family paying double for the party goods, outfits, etc. It's an expensive day, but it gives incentive for the merchants in the city to remain loyal and the townspeople love a parade. This year Mira has requested that Ifir go in her stead, as she would rather stay in with the prince and prepare for the feast at the end of the day. 

- elduin wants ifir to come back the light and have the baby there, mentions pain of childbirth as a motivation
- lili is speechless before elduin when she sees him, ezrah falls in line, salgrim holds back out of respect for his power
- the only ones who stand up for her are dama and mira

"No. She gets to decide where she has this baby and who is present. You don't get to take that from her, and you damn sure won't take that from me."

"I choose what's best for her and the child. You think you have claim to this infant simply because my daughter found you pretty? Found you charming? The child may share your filthy blood but a few decades in the Light and she'll be pure as a star, as it should be."
