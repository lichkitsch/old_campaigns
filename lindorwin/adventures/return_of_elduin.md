# Return of Elduin

Ifir sees bright white light surrounding her. She is in her angelic form, floating in empty space. She hears a familiar voice, like a rumble of thunder from miles away. "You could have told me you were unhappy. I would have let you leave."

Ifir wakes in the middle of the night, terrified. She comes downstairs and finds Salgrim reading in the dining hall while servants rush back and forth in the kitchen. It's the early morning hours of Queen Mira's birthday, a holiday observed by the city of Steson that typically involves the royal family paying double for the party goods, outfits, etc. It's an expensive day, but it gives incentive for the merchants in the city to remain loyal and the townspeople love a parade. This year Mira has requested that Ifir go in her stead, as she would rather stay in with the prince and prepare for the feast at the end of the day.

Ifir, Ezrah, and Dama return to the castle and are greeted by Lili, Sal, and Mira. Mira has been notified about the attack and she apologizes profusely to Ifir for having put her in harm's way. That's when Ifir hears her father's voice.

"You shouldn't bother apologizing. It's her duty, after all."

There's a bright light and Elduin appears in his human form, an image of his celestial self flickering for a moment. He approaches the group.

"You've been ignoring my messages."

"How did you come to be with child?"

"You are coming back to the light, and you'll have the child there."

"Your mindless behavior of late has cost us progress on multiple fronts, but I suppose I can only expect so much. I've been lenient recently as well."

- lili is speechless before elduin when she sees him, ezrah falls in line, salgrim holds back out of respect for his power
- the only ones who stand up for her are dama and mira

"You may have power over there but the rules are different here. Here, in this place, I make the rules. Here, with our daughter, I have a say."

"Forgive me, Mira, but you no longer hold my reins and I require her participation, else the sun will cease to rise and this land will choke and die in darkness."

"Don't be so dramatic, your battles with the Dark are irrelevant. My oracles have seen how they scrap and thrash about at their own throats. There is no threat from the Dark while the Throne of Blood remains empty."

"The Throne will not always sit empty. We must prepare. She will return to the Light and produce the child there, and we will return to our-"

"No. She gets to decide where she has this baby and who is present. You don't get to take that from her, and you damn sure won't take that from me."

"Impudent boy! I choose what's best for her and the child. You think you have claim to this infant simply because my daughter found you pretty? Found you charming? The child may share your filthy blood but a few decades in the Light and she'll be pure as a star, as it should be."

Dama draws his sword and stands between Elduin and Ifir. Elduin laughs and waves his hand, a blast of pressure rockets towards Dama. It tosses him back, but Dama merely gets back up and raises his sword again.

"Fine. I can be flexible, but I will only bend so far. The moment the child is born, should you survive it, your little impromptu vacation is over. You and the child will return to your home and you **will** resume your duties as a Child of Light."

## The Willywock
The gnolls take Ifir's side. For ages their people worshipped violent, bloodthirsty demons and gods. It took many generations of frightening tribal warfare before they were even somewhat accepted in civilized society, railing against their ancestors and their gods when they saw peace and family as something worth protecting. Lili becomes frustrated with them, unable to decouple her faith in the Light with her feelings for Knutt, Rutt, and Ifir. Lili disappears that night, her bag missing. The gnolls leave in pursuit to find her and convince her to come back. (When she does, she's burned off her sun tattoo and disavowed the Light, swearing fealty to the Spellsongs and to Ifir. She believed the Light supported choice and freedom and was disillusioned by Elduin's treatment of Ifir)

## Afterwards
Back at the castle Sophia, the battle-hardened commander of the guard, shares their findings on the Silence. Elduin adds to their findings, revealing the ancient creature they worship: an eldritch beast of cosmic proportion which drives people mad and takes their voices as tribute. Elduin claims the horror doesn't exist and the Silence are a fanatical group led by the mentally ill. Nonetheless, the city is in danger while the Silence are about.

Elduin promises to send a troop of angels down to cleanse the city, but threatens that their second priority will be "protecting" Ifir and the baby until the birth, since she insists on remaining in Steson. They will then be responsible for bringing her back to the Light. 

Just before Ifir's father leaves, Mira comments "You were a decent father once, El. What happened?" He pauses but does not turn around or speak, and is gone in a flash of light.

Elduin is sending a batallion to defend Mira from the cult.

"Shut up Dama." and Ifir saw he had stolen the ring back at some point.

"This isn't all about you." Mira said before going back inside.

Ezra is human now, his wings ripped off. Sal heard Ifir say "He should have known this would happen."



Ifir fights with Dama and goes to see Ezrah, then goes back to her room.

After a few weeks Ezrah is feeling somewhat better and talks to Ifir, leading her to apologize to him. Dama quits his job and returns to his ruffian style, and they frick so her dad can hear.
