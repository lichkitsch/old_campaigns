# Anjouville
The party is together in White Vale, preparing to journey to Salgrim's home. They've eaten and it's time to rest. There are bunks available, but Ifir is having trouble sleeping. If she takes a walk, she'll find Vela at the showers.

Julius said "You're gonna make a great mama bear" when Ifir asked what kind of animal she reminds him of.

Talking about angel forms, Dama finally understands what they really look like, still on the road to Anjouville.

The party sets out for the gnomish city of Anjouville (ahn-zhoo-vee). Anjouville is an ancient underground city in the far north, accessible by entrances found in the mountains. While Sal is returning home for personal reasons, the group is following along because the underground city would be the perfect place to hide from Polaris' view and thus hide from Elduin's gaze.

The group consists of: Ifir, Dama, Ezrah, Salgrim, Ilien, Julius, Vela, and Ursa. Ifir is a little more than halfway along in her pregnancy, Dama and Ezrah are becoming closer, Sal is on a mission, Ilien left Polly to tend to White Vale, Julius and Vela are past the point of no return, and Ursa is struggling to come to terms with Elduin's betrayal.

When they finally reach the mountain entrance, Salgrim is greeted by three armed gnomish guards and the party is questioned before being allowed entrance. The trek down into the depths of the earth is interesting: a tunnel stretches before them with smaller offshoots connecting into the main shaft, glowing crystals providing dim lighting. The gnomes have not fully converted to technology and instead rely heavily on magic. The tunnel opens up into an enormous underground cavern with massive pillars positioned at intervals which support the ceiling above. There are carefully planned streets with tiered platforms housing neighborhoods, all roughly the same size but with a variety of shapes and colors. The largest building is positioned near the center. Sal tells the history of the city as they travel through the streets, gnomes staring as they pass. There are very few non-gnomish folk in the city, and Ifir sees a handful of humans, elves, and even a half-orc on the trip to the center.

The large, domed building in the center is called the Lieu de Rencontre (Meeting Place). Gnomes meet here to vote on important matters and discuss trade, city management, surface engagement, and more. The building also houses the main hospital, with smaller branches set in each of the eight districts. The hospital is where Sal heads first, but the main group must meet with the Conseil des Ma√Ætres (Council of Masters) and request permission to stay in Anjouville. The council is harsh but fair, allowing the group to stay within the city walls but they will be required to work to support the city and its inhabitants.

### Council
- Adeline (roads): younger, joyful but smart
- Sonia (trade): older, curious
- Lambert (artisans): older, gloomy
- Stanislas (mining): older, boastful
- Adrienne (health): older, exacting
- Emmanuel (education): younger, shy and self-conscious
- Henri (security): older, exacting
- Blanche (utilities): older, honest

In the hospital, Sal is sitting with her sick wife Rosalie. Rosalie is suffering from a strange illness; her body is weak and she's been slowly losing feeling starting in her toes and moving upward. Now she can barely move her arms. Salgrim became a cleric and left to find a cure for the illness, and she's found a mixture of medicine and magic that might do the trick. Rosalie is doubtful there's a cure for what she has, but is incredibly grateful that her love has returned.

Salgrim offers to open her home to the group. She lives in a neighborhood plot not far from the Lieu de Rencontre, her daughter and her family living in the house she left behind. There's not room for many, and the party must split up between this house and the guest lodging nearby.

### Sal's Family:
Daughter Lola (teacher) and stay-at-home husband Bertrand, young son Emile and baby girl Martine.
Son Maxime, single and working as an artisan (woodworking).

### Back in Steson
While the party is exploring Anjouville, a masked face is staking out Steson. They are spying on the city under lockdown. The masked figure retreats into the forest on the far side of the lake, into a camouflaged pit-camp. The figure removes their mask and hood to reveal that it's Lili. She looks different; her hair is cut shorter and there is a wrap around her shoulder. Her eyes are fierce and determined. She sits with the gnolls who were waiting in the pit-camp for her. They have meat on a small travel grill, and offer a skewer to Lili, which she takes and bites into with a frown. "There's no wasy way into the city, but if what I've heard is true then our friends aren't there." The gnolls remain quiet as Lili continues. "We can try and track them, but apparently w they disappeared into thin air about a week ago." She takes another bite of the meat skewer. Knutt says "No tracks to follow. Should we stay?" Lili nods and replies, "We have to find a way into the city. We need to make her home safe again for when she returns."

Back in Anjouville, everyone must find jobs in the city if they are going to be allowed to stay and hide out here.

## Jobs
- Ezrah quickly finds work as a laborer, his strength and size coming in handy on construction projects.
- Julius and Ilien find jobs as scribes, copying texts in the Lieu de Rencontre's library.
- Ursa joins the security division, assigned to trade councilwoman Sonia.
- Vela works at the Hospital, practicing her healing magic with Salgrim.
- Dama struggles to find work, and is at risk of being removed from the city. Luckily, babysitter counts as a job and he can assist Bertrand with caring for Sal's grandchildren.
- Ifir is given a pass, as being pregnant (creating life) is regarded as a full-time job in Anjouville, but is allowed to play her violin for coin.

## Plot Hooks
1. Adrienne and Blanche are investigating a strange illness arising from a discolored water source.
2. Emmanuel is a necromancer who collects the skulls of important, intelligent people to use as direct reference. He requests help retrieving the skull of a dead alchemist, whose body is interred in the Maison du Souvenir (House of Remembrance).
3. Bertrand is having trouble with a noisy bard neighbor who insists on practicing his horn playing at odd hours.

### The Goal
1. Find the source of the disease and help to stop the spread.
2. Convince the alchemist's family to let Emmanuel use his body for education.
3. Convince the bard to schedule his practice time or move away.

## Encounter 1 - Entrance with Guardian
1. The filthy water has been dammed off from the reservoir and gnomes are working with magic to clean the water supply. There's an entrance to the pipe that draws the water in, but the liquid within is glowing purple and oddly viscous. Moving through the sludge causes -1HP on a failed CON save every 50 feet, and the pipe is easily 200 feet to the next exit.
2. What Emmanuel failed to mention is that the alchemist died quite recently and his funeral was today. The Maison du Souvenir is filled with mourners coming to pay their respects to Armand. Ifir can leave, but she was offered access to information that Emmanuel claims she could really use.
3. The bard's house is locked and he's currently practicing, not listening to the knocking on the door. The door is locked, but there's a hidden key under the welcome mat and the windows are open. The house is out in the open, however, and there are people milling about, so breaking in could potentially cause a scene.

## Encounter 2 - Puzzle/RP Challenge
1. The pipe has a hatch that requires a bit of traction to open (due to the strange liquid) but once it is the hatch leads up to a small alcove next to the pipe, a little station with a locked door. The door will need to be unlocked but once inside there is a complicated instrument panel. The only thing that is easily understood is that the pressure gauge is at maximum and there's a flashing light that reads "obstruction present" on the console.
2. After wandering through the crowd and coming upon the body, Ifir feels a chill on the back of her neck. She is guided by a strange force to a quiet corner of the Maison where Armand's ghost appears and addresses her. As it turns out, Armand wants his skull to rest in the library. He was a great teacher and to continue imparting his knowledge after death would mean quite a lot to him.
3. Upon entering the house, the music stops. The first floor is empty, though it looks quite lived-in. A steaming cup of tea sits on the dining table. The bard comes up from the basement and is surprised by an intruder, but the music was clearly coming from upstairs.

## Encounter 3 - Trick/Setback
1. Upon pressing the "remove obstruction" button, the hatch flies off and a torrent of purple liquid gushes forth, pouring out into the small cavern and building up outside the station. The liquid then starts to coalesce into the shape of a creature which makes a sloshing sound and starts pounding on the door of the little station.
2. While Ifir was speaking with the alchemist, the crowd starts to scream and move away from the coffin, where the body of the alchemist has risen from the coffin, it's eyes blazing with blue fire as it speaks. It claims to be an old rival of the alchemist, a sorcerer named Corbeau, who waited for Armand to die so he could have his revenge for Armand's failure to save his life.
3. As it turns out, the bard wasn't practicing squat. He had a record player set up to make it sound like he was practicing while he was working on something in his basement. What was he hiding? The bard takes off, running away from the house. If Ifir has help, she can send the other person after him, or try to chase him down (disadvantage), and/or she can investigate the basement.

## Encounter 4 - Climax
1. The purple slime beast (HP40 B2 M1 H1) must be defeated, which is helped by the rods of ice kept in a panel on the wall.
2. The doors of the Maison shut tightly and Corbeau (HP20 B0 M3 H1) uses his ghostly fire magic to try and bring the building down on the mourner's heads. Armand's ghost can enter his old body and attempt to wrench Corbeau away, distracting him so Ifir can get in some hits on the body.
3. The bard's house crumbles down into the earth and a giant cave snail (HP30 B3 M-2 H-1) slowly crawls out of the rubble and starts down the street after the bard.

## Reward/Revelation
1. Upon defeating the beast the water is easily cleaned and Ifir is allowed to keep one of the ice rods as a gift.
2. Armand thanks Ifir for her help once Corbeau is defeated, and upon returning to Emmanuel with the alchemist's skull he reveals that he has met Anabushka and that she's been attempting to find Ifir, but that she wasn't in the city. He can call upon her and Anabushka can explain to Ifir that she knows a way to get to the moon and rescue Polaris. (It's the next quest, so it will take some time to prepare. Maybe the baby will be born on the moon???).
3. The bard's been raising the snail in his basement and selling it's slime as an instrument cleaner, which is pretty unethical. He can be put to hard labor as punishment, with a relatively short sentence. The snail is to be set free off in one of the caves adjacent to the city where it will help create tunnels for mining. Reward: bottle of giant cave snail slime (excellent lubricant)
