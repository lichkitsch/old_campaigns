# Anjouville

## Setup
The party is together in White Vale, preparing to journey to Salgrim's home. They've eaten and it's time to rest. There are bunks available, but Ifir is having trouble sleeping. If she takes a walk, she'll find Vela at the showers.

The party sets out for the gnomish city of Anjouville (ahn-zhoo-vee). Anjouville is an ancient underground city in the far north, accessible by entrances found in the mountains. While Sal is returning home for personal reasons, the group is following along because the underground city would be the perfect place to hide from Polaris' view and thus hide from Elduin's gaze.

The group consists of: Ifir, Dama, Ezrah, Salgrim, Ilien, Julius, Vela, and Ursa. Ifir is a little more than halfway along in her pregnancy, Dama and Ezrah are becoming closer, Sal is on a mission, Ilien left Polly to tend to White Vale, Julius and Vela are past the point of no return, and Ursa is struggling to come to terms with Elduin's betrayal.

When they finally reach the mountain entrance, Salgrim is greeted by three armed gnomish guards and the party is questioned before being allowed entrance. The trek down into the depths of the earth is interesting: a tunnel stretches before them with smaller offshoots connecting into the main shaft, glowing crystals providing dim lighting. The gnomes have not fully converted to technology and instead rely heavily on magic. The tunnel opens up into an enormous underground cavern with massive pillars positioned at intervals which support the ceiling above. There are carefully planned streets with tiered platforms housing neighborhoods, all roughly the same size but with a variety of shapes and colors. The largest building is positioned near the center. Sal tells the history of the city as they travel through the streets, gnomes staring as they pass. There are very few non-gnomish folk in the city, and Ifir sees a handful of humans, elves, and even a half-orc on the trip to the center.

The large, domed building in the center is called the Lieu de Rencontre (Meeting Place). Gnomes meet here to vote on important matters and discuss trade, city management, surface engagement, and more. The building also houses the main hospital, with smaller branches set in each of the eight districts. The hospital is where Sal heads first, but the main group must meet with the Conseil des Ma√Ætres (Council of Masters) and request permission to stay in Anjouville. The council is harsh but fair, allowing the group to stay within the city walls but they will be required to work to support the city and its inhabitants.

### Council
Adeline (roads): younger, joyful but smart
Sonia (trade): older, curious
Lambert (artisans): older, gloomy
Stanislas (mining): older, boastful
Adrienne (health): older, exacting
Emmanuel (education): younger, shy and self-conscious
Henri (security): older, exacting
Blanche (utilities): older, honest

In the hospital, Sal is sitting with her sick wife Rosalie. Rosalie is suffering from a strange illness; her body is weak and she's been slowly losing feeling starting in her toes and moving upward. Now she can barely move her arms. Salgrim became a cleric and left to find a cure for the illness, and she's found a mixture of medicine and magic that might do the trick. Rosalie is doubtful there's a cure for what she has, but is incredibly grateful that her love has returned.

Salgrim offers to open her home to the group. She lives in a neighborhood plot not far from the Lieu de Rencontre, her daughter and her family living in the house she left behind. There's not room for many, and the party must split up between this house and the guest lodging nearby.

### Sal's Family:
Daughter Lola (teacher) and stay-at-home husband Bertrand, young son Emile and baby girl Martine.
Son Maxime, single and working as an artisan (woodworking).

### Back in Steson
While the party is exploring Anjouville, a masked face is staking out Steson. They are spying on the city under lockdown. The masked figure retreats into the forest on the far side of the lake, into a camouflaged pit-camp. The figure removes their mask and hood to reveal that it's Lili. She looks different; her hair is cut shorter and there is a wrap around her shoulder. Her eyes are fierce and determined. She sits with the gnolls who were waiting in the pit-camp for her. They have meat on a small travel grill, and offer a skewer to Lili, which she takes and bites into with a frown. "There's no wasy way into the city, but if what I've heard is true then our friends aren't there." The gnolls remain quiet as Lili continues. "We can try and track them, but apparently w they disappeared into thin air about a week ago." She takes another bite of the meat skewer. Knutt says "No tracks to follow. Should we stay?" Lili nods and replies, "We have to find a way into the city. We need to make her home safe again for when she returns."

Back in Anjouville, everyone must find jobs in the city if they are going to be allowed to stay and hide out here.

## Jobs
- Ezrah quickly finds work as a laborer, his strength and size coming in handy on construction projects.
- Julius and Ilien find jobs as scribes, copying texts in the Lieu de Rencontre's library.
- Ursa joins the security division, assigned to trade councilwoman Sonia.
- Vela works at the Hospital, practicing her healing magic with Salgrim.
- Dama struggles to find work, and is at risk of being removed from the city. Luckily, babysitter counts as a job and he can assist Bertrand with caring for Sal's grandchildren.
- Ifir is given a pass, as being pregnant (creating life) is regarded as a full-time job in Anjouville, but is allowed to play her violin for coin.
