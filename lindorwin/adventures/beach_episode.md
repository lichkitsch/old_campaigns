# The Beach Episode

## Prologue
After lots of action, drama, danger, and surprises the party wants to take a well-earned vacation, but there are emotional obstacles in the way:

- Ifir is pregnant and doesn't know whether the father is Dama or Ezrah.
- Dama is processing the fact that his mother traded the chance to seek him out as a child for magical power.
- Ezrah lied to Ifir, saying he prefers her elven form to her angelic form, but Ifir sensed he was lying.
- Lili is reeling from her mother dropping her half-sister in her lap after not having contact with her for 15 years.

Salgrim plans a island getaway with help from Mira to give the party a break. They head to the Jewel Coast and board a ship heading out to the island.

During the trip to the island a storm builds up and eventually becomes big enough to scare Ifir, who finds comfort via sex with Ezrah. Post-coitus, Ifir confronts Ezrah about his lie regarding her two forms.

After landing on the island the party drops their stuff off at the Spellsong beach house, a small manor situated on a hill overlooking the beach. There's a small garden and the island is tended to by an older couple, Tipi and Corona, and their pet bugbear(?) named Porkchop.

Pippa (female human, asian, spry) and her wife Corona (female demon, reformed, escaped the pit to find peaceful simple life) watch over the island year round. They seem surprised to have visitors. "Remy and the former King and Queen were only just here, usually there's some time inbetween guests is all." The two claim to have to prepare the manor for the group and set them up with a campfire on the beach. (They like having the island to themselves because they're free to be as kinky as they want when they're alone.)
