# The Beach Episode

## Prologue
After lots of action, drama, danger, and surprises the party wants to take a well-earned vacation, but there are emotional obstacles in the way:

- Ifir is pregnant and doesn't know whether the father is Dama or Ezrah.
- Dama is processing the fact that his mother traded the chance to seek him out as a child for magical power.
- Ezrah lied to Ifir, saying he prefers her elven form to her angelic form, but Ifir sensed he was lying.
- Lili is reeling from her mother dropping her half-sister in her lap after not having contact with her for 15 years.
- Salgrim ...?

The party is treated to a trip to the coast by Mira. They pack their things and prepare to stay at the Spellsong beach house.
