After lots of action, drama, danger, and surprises the party wants to take a well-earned vacation, but there are emotional obstacles in the way:

- Ifir is pregnant and doesn't know whether the father is Dama or Ezrah.
- Dama is processing the fact that his mother traded the chance to seek him out as a child for magical power.
- Ezrah lied to Ifir, saying he prefers her elven form to her angelic form, but Ifir sensed he was lying.
- Lili is reeling from her mother dropping her half-sister in her lap after not having contact with her for 15 years.

Petra requests that the group take a break and visit the family island for a weekend. They head to the Jewel Coast and board a ship heading out to the island.

During the trip to the island a storm builds up and eventually becomes big enough to scare Ifir, who finds comfort via sex with Ezrah. Post-coitus, Ifir confronts Ezrah about his lie regarding her two forms.

**Stopping Point**
"Maybe it would be better for the baby to feel things like you do."

After landing on the island the party unloads near the Spellsong beach house, a small manor situated on a hill overlooking the beach. There's a small garden, hot springs, and a forest on the island. It is attended by a married couple, Pippa and Corona, and their three-legged pet bugbear named Porkchop.

Pippa (female human, asian, spry) and her wife Corona (female demon, reformed, escaped the dark to find peaceful simple life) watch over the island year round. They seem surprised to have visitors. "Remy and the former King and Queen were only just here, usually there's some time inbetween guests is all." The two claim to have to prepare the manor for the group and set them up with a campfire on the beach. (They like having the island to themselves because they're free to be as kinky as they want when they're alone.)

While sitting around the campfire the group starts to tell spooky stories:

1. Dama's okay at it (ghost of a mad wizard haunting the air where his tower used to stand)
2. Lili is great at it (haunted house where everything is mimics, including the house itself)
3. Ezrah is terrible at it (a man was killed tragically before his time and became a ghost)

Then Porkchop scares the group and Pippa and Corona come out, laughing at them. They tell them the legend about the island and the manbeast that lurks in the forest and how Porkchop lost a leg fighting it off. (Porkchop was born with only three legs).

Everyone heads off to their rooms for the night. In the middle of the night Ifir is woken by strange sounds coming from the forest outside her window. Scared, she goes to see Dama and tell him about the sounds. She walks in on him masturbating.

Presumably they have sex, then Ifir wants to investigate the grounds. They find the gnolls double-teaming Lili down by the hot springs. Orgy?

Sal and Ezrah are up playing a card game when they go back inside. "Have a nice hike? You're all very sweaty."

The following morning Ezrah is helping Ifir pack when he asks why Ifir didn't tell Dama that she knew about his mother. Dama overhears this and becomes cold towards Ifir on the trip back to the mainland.
