# The Journey to Castle Spellsong

The party is still at the bath houses and Ifir wants to play her shamisen for coin.

After gathering a few supplies, the party spends some money to travel down the river on a ferry. While riding the ferry they meet **Salgrim the Gnome Cleric** who is seeking an urgent audience with Queen Mira Spellsong, Ifir's mother. When the party arrives in Steson, they are greeted by the Royal Attendant, Tybalt. Salgrim sort of maneuvers his way with the party, as there are far more guests than expected and he knows how to blend in. 

At the castle (huge spires with seven 40ft. tall statues of elven knights "defending" the walls) the party is introduced to Ifir's half-sisters Yuna and Setra. There's a heartfelt greeting followed by a light scolding for bringing a whole band of filthy bandits(?) into the castle, during which Yuna giggles and points out that Dama would pass for a prince if it weren't for the scars and the stink. Setra, the more composed sister, explains that Mira has only just given birth to their new baby brother, Prince Elomar, and needs to rest. In the meantime, the sisters have been dealing with a string of kidnappings that have gotten closer to the castle and neither the royal guard nor the Steson militia has had any luck sussing out the culprits, and so if you'd be so kind as to entertain yourselves for the night, we're ever so busy...

Ifir has a room at the castle in one of the spires, but the rest of the party is required to lodge in the barracks (behind bars) or find lodging in the city. Lili likely is fine sleeping in the barracks, as are the gnolls, but Salgrim and Dama opt to find lodging in an inn close to the castle.

Dama sneaks out at night and attempts to meet Ifir at her room, asks to take her on a proper date after being insulted by his sisters. He "finds" a quaint tavern with "the best candybread I've ever tasted" only to find out that it's the establishment run by Ifir's adoptive mother Holly Willywock, a large, boisterous, and charming woman with a knack for cookery. They share a meal together and Ifir tells Dama about her second family and investigates her feelings towards them.

After the meal, Dama wants to see the city and the two adventure for a bit. There's a park, a theater, an artisan's guild, the market, etc.

A servant boy comes running up to the two and, out of breath, exclaims that they are needed urgently back at the castle. Upon arriving, Tybalt explains that Elomar has been kidnapped. The party joins the investigation, heading to the edges of the city where gamblers, brigands, and untrustworthy merchants reside. With some digging, they can uncover that a demon-worshipping cult is taking people for use in dark rituals.

## The Sewers of Steson
Beneath the city of Steson, a network of tunnels and pipelines sprawl out in every direction, forming a massive maze. The sewers are mainly for plumbing but have been used in the past by smugglers to carry illegal goods into the city proper. Found here are rats, dire rats, cultists, and an entrance to the catacombs beneath the Temple of Aviron (though the party won't find this out until they surface).

## The Catacombs
The sewers connect with a series of catacombs, a mausoleum beneath a temple. There are more cultists here and jail cells with kidnapped victims. The Leader is running a ritual in the main hall, holding Prince Elomar in one hand and a Book of Death in the other. He can increase the power of his disciples with evocations, causing them to deform in demonic ways.

## Aftermath
Once Leader is defeated and Elomar is safe, the party returns the child to Mira. Mira recognizes Dama instantly as the child of the Mad Alchemist and has him detained.
