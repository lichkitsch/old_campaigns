### Durability
"Durable" obstacles are goals that require a certain amount of effort, and possibly multiple attempts. Usually this means hostile creatures, but it could also refer to locked doors and chests, traversing difficult terrain, persuading a stubborn NPC, and much more. These obstacles have endurance, stamina, or health, and cannot be overcome until their "durability" reaches zero.

Players can reduce an obstacle's durability by making successful action rolls and rolling for effort. This is where player choice and stat bonuses shine. Consider the following scenario: the party must gain entrance to a secured, exclusive dinner party without an invitation. Characters might have different methods of overcoming this obstacle based on their traits.

1. Use **STR** to scale the wall and sneak in.
2. Use **DEX** to steal a legitimate invitation.
3. Use **INT** to memorize the guard patterns and find a hole in the defenses.
4. Use **WIS** to create a distraction and slip in unseen.
5. Use **CHA** to convince the guard that you simply misplaced your invite.

**Trait** rolls reflect your method of conflict resolution and the attempt's success. **Effect** rolls represent the progress made from a successful action. For example, the following effect rolls might apply if you chose to use **STR** to scale the wall: 

1. Roll *Unaided* for barehanded, untethered, old-fashioned rock climbing.
2. Roll *Tools* if you're using a grappling hook with a rope to climb.
3. Roll *Magic* if you're using gloves magically enchanted with an adhesive spell.
4. Roll *Critical* if your action roll was a natural 20.

The result of the effect roll is subtracted from the obstacle's durability until it reaches zero.
