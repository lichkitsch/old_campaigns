Some obstacles have durability that must be reduced before they are overcome. Obstacle durability is reduced through players making successful action rolls and rolling for effort. This is where players choice and stat bonuses shine. 

Consider the following scenario: the party must gain entrance to a secured, exclusive dinner party without an invitation. Characters might have different methods of accomplishing this based on their traits.

1. Use STR to scale the wall and sneak in.
2. Use DEX to steal a legitimate invitation.
3. Use INT to memorize the guard patterns and find a hole in the defenses.
4. Use WIS to create a distraction and slip in unseen.
5. Use CHA to convince the guard that you simply misplaced your invite.

**Trait** rolls reflect your method of conflict resolution and the attempt's success. **Effect** rolls represent the progress made from a successful action. Suppose you decide to scale the wall using your character's STR stat; the effect dice you would roll depends on how they are taking the action.

1. Roll *Unaided* for barehanded, untethered, old-fashioned rock climbing.
2. Roll *Tools* if you're using a grappling hook with a rope to climb.
3. Roll *Magic* if you're using gloves magically enchanted with an adhesive spell.
4. Roll *Critical* if your action roll was a natural 20.
