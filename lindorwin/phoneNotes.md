cleric offers descarification to ifir

---

The party is invited to Hotel Seabring by its owner, Horace, after they saved him from the kidnapper cult. The hotel is big and beautiful, but there’s no patrons. Horace explains at dinner that the hotel is known to have a dry season thanks to a story about ghosts that arrive at the same time every year, always accompanied by a tragic death.

The ghosts are a pair of star crossed lovers, a runaway bride, a handsome bard, and a new strange apparition that appears as smoke.

The crime: Horace is killed by ...?

The truth: The apparition is the reaper come to ferry the lost souls to the Pale. The lovers, wanting to stay on this plane, kill someone once a year to distract the reaper while they enjoy themselves for a night. The goal becomes trapping the lovers before sunrise so the reaper can catch them and complete his duty.

The lovers are troublemakers and flirt with the party, kissing lili and ifir and making them switch bodies. After some shenanigans (ifir w/ gnolls, lili w/ dama) lili, ifir, and dama are taken hostage by the lovers.

"Look pal, I’m just doing my job. If I could find the other two buggers I’d take em first, but I’ve had enough trouble as it is just grabbing these two."
"Please, there must be a way to give us more time."

-Salgrim shows up, dirty and sweaty and carrying her shortstaff. She offers to help the reaper find and trap the other ghosts.

After catching Yellow eyes, she explains that to switch back she needs to kiss Ifir while her husband kisses Lili. Anabushka refuses to unchain him and the only other way to switch would be a ritual involving carnal magic. Salgrim knows of one, though she’s hesitant to take part in it.

Anabushka promises to leave Rori’s wife for last and proceeds to watch the ritual alongside Dama and the Gnolls. Salgrim offers privacy, which Lili declines and leaves up to Ifir. Sal uses chalk to etch markings on the floor, creating a magic circle that the two have to stay within.

Sal says "Alright both of you sip this (a pearly, deep-blue liquid in a glass jar) and y’know... get to it. If you both manage to erm... finish... you’ll sleep and wake back in your bodies. Just don’t leave the circle."

Back in their bodies, Anabushka presses that there’s one more ghost to capture; a druid named Vavi. She turns into different ghostly animals and has spells for manipulating them which wear off with time, as with the gnolls and with Lala.

Vavi is found back at the hotel, tearing shit up in the dining hall. "Alright you can try to take me, but I won’t make it easy on you!" -bear-

Ana turns into the smokey figure, tendrils spinning and chains whirling about. After a quick battle Vavi is contained, the gnolls calm down, and there’s a loud noise as Lala shrinks up on the roof.

Anabushka flirts with Ifir and loosely asks if she’d be up for a romp sometime.

Rori asks to go with Anabushka, not wanting to leave his wife. Knowing that he doesn’t have much time left anyway, Ana accepts.

Belby thanks the group for their help and gently urges them to leave before Horace wakes and blames the state of the hotel (and his paralysis) on them. Her and Estrod start cleaning up.
