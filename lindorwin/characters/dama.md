## Mind
DEX +3 / INT +0  
Dama knows how to gamble, flirt, and fight. He's a defensive fighter, making good use of his shield as well as his curved sword. Dama is afraid of bears, abandonment, and losing his loved ones.

## Heart
WIS +0 / CHA +2  
Dama and his mother were exiled from the Beetle Wilds when he was still young. They were sent north where, after a few weeks of surviving in the wilderness, Dama was attacked by a bear. The bear left him with a scar, but his mother sacrificed herself to save him. Dama then spent his formative years with various gangs of criminals. He eventually made his way to the Desert of Brass where he could be close to his old home without breaking his exile. Dama wants a family, people who accept him as he is and with whom he can feel like he belongs.
