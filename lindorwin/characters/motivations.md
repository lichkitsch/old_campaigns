# NPC Motivations

## Dama
### History
Dama was born in a jungle to the east of the Desert of Brass to a chieftain and his wife. Dama's mother dabbled in dangerous magic and accidentally killed her father, something Dama never found out. Word reached the Spellsongs of Dama's mother's dark dealings and the tribe was given an ultimatum: exile the heretic and her brood or face annihilation. The tribe chose exile. His mother was forced to take Dama into the north. Dama's mother told him that the tribe had abandoned them over a misunderstanding but wouldn't give him any more details than that. They survived for a few months before Dama was attacked by a bear and received his scar. Dama's mother protected him but is presumed to have died in the fight. He ran away from the forest and was picked up by a band of brigands. They taught him the way of the cutpurse and he rose through the ranks until he eventually left the band and started an operation of his own in the Desert of Brass, close to home but not close enough to break his exile and face the consequences. He's had a hard life and hasn't been allowed to make many choices for himself. The ring he lost to Ifir was the last memory of his mother, a sore spot and at this point he's unsure if he even wants it back, as the rumors of who his mother really was made their way to him. He doesn't know what to believe, and so tries to forget his past completely.

Dama is falling in love with Ifir; she's free to make her own choices and fights against the notion that her free will could be anything but her own, something he admires. He's jealous of Ezrah, but he also thinks that Ifir shouldn't be with someone who would see her "tied down," so to speak.

He wants to protect her, to see her safe and happy, and to make her smile. If he can, maybe he can see her become the family he so yearns for.

## Lili
### History
Lili grew up in Kidwy, a desert oasis with a religion that worships Ifir's father, Eldoin. His teachings were sparse; obey the light and defend against evil. This led to lots of things being loosely interpreted. Sex, drugs, etc. were not specifically banned by their patron. Children in Kidwy grow up only knowing their mothers as true family but are raised by the village as a whole. They have a reverence for maintaining their physical forms, ready to fight for the Light when the time comes and they are called to battle.

Some children are gifted animal companions to act as guides through life, the bond created between them becoming unbreakable by the time the children reach adulthood. Lili and Ningal have been together for a very long time, and she has an admiration (and curiosity) towards beasts of the land. She's never thought about becoming a mother, having had a strained relationship with her own.

## Salgrim


## Ezrah
### History
Ezrah is an angel, a soldier of the Light and a paladin working under Ifir's father. He and Ifir are betrothed to be married and are best friends. Ezrah is a tad dense and doesn't pick up on social cues easily, but he fights with ferocity using his magically-invoked morningstar. He loves Ifir, but some part of the affection comes from the exotic nature of her being half-elf and half-angel. Ezrah will follow commands with vigor, provided he respects the commander, and presses others to follow suit, a tendency that has led to fights with Ifir, who wants to be her own.

Ezrah doesn't trust non-angels; he believes that the "beasts of the world" are worth protecting but only because the Light (and Aviron) would be without worshippers should they disappear. The Light receives power through worship, a power that Ezrah fully believes is only ever used for good. Given his nature and position, he doubly doesn't trust Dama.

## Mira
Queen Mira Spellsong was once Princess Mira, beautiful and graceful heir to the Spellsong throne. Stories of her beauty found their way to Eldoin, who was spending time prostelytizing for the Light. He wooed her and gave her a child, believing elves to be the highest and most worthy of the races that roam Lindorwin. Shortly after Ifir was born Eldoin spirited her away to the Light.
