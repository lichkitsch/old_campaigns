[goals]
what are their long-term and short-term goals?

  long-term: to forget his past and create a new life
  
  short-term: to learn about ifir and her past, but also have sex with her again

[backstory]
what events led them to have these goals?

  long-term: when he was a young child dama was a prince and his father and mother ruled a small jungle settlement near the desert of brass. his mother dabbled in dangerous magic and alchemy, merging the flesh of elves and beasts. her experiments killed dama's father, an incident he witnessed and blames on himself. when word reached steson of the dark dealings, lotelias invaded their jungle and destroyed their castle, exiling their people to the north beyond the mountains. dama and his mother were banished by their people and roamed the forests for a time, during which dama got his scars from a bear. his mother presumably died defending him, and he found his way to a troop of bandits where he learned the ways of the rogue. he ended up back in the desert, wanting to return to his home but too afraid of what he might find there.

  short-term: ifir hot

[flaws]
what is holding them back?

  fear of being tied to his past forever, fear of not being able to let go and move on, the small lingering doubt that he had something to do with his father's death.

[personality]
what do their goals, past, and flaws reveal about who they are?

  dama is guarded and secretive of his past because he's afraid that if people knew about his mother they would shun him, but also knowing that he can't find a new family if he isn't willing to open up and be honest about where he came from.

[information]
what do they know that the pc doesnâ€™t?

  dama doesn't know anything that ifir doesn't, he's on this journey alongside her
