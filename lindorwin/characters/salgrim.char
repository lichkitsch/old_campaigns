[goals]
what are their long-term and short-term goals?
  
  long-term: salgrim wants to spread the word of va'shuth, a gospel of justice and fairness, and to stop as much death as possible

  short-term: warn the queen of the coming danger

[backstory]
what events led them to have these goals?

  she holds herself to blame for her late wife's death (a disease she didn't understand and couldn't cure with her knowledge at the time) and became a cleric late in life partly to repent

  short-term: she received a vision from the goddess va'shuth that the new prince was in danger

[flaws]
what is holding them back?

  disappointment and degradation of herself keeps her from accepting that there are things out of her control

[personality]
what do their goals, past, and flaws reveal about who they are?

  salgrim is a bit of a control freak, she feels deeply but comes across as borderline apathetic due to bottling things up. she's determined and loyal, and has no patience for criminals

[information]
what do they know that the pc doesnâ€™t?
salgrim knew ahead of time that the prince was in danger and that they wouldn't save him in perfect condition
