# The Story So Far...
- Ifir escapes the Light. She touches down at a small town in the north called Berrivale and spends two months living in the wilderness with Lala, catching up on romance novels and enjoying the peace and distance from her father.
- Ifir decides it’s time to go see her mother and heads out east.

## Brass Master’s Keep
- While passing over the Desert of Brass, Ifir lands and finds Lili, a human monk, passed out and half-covered in sand. Lili wakes and immediately starts walking along the river to find her tiger Ningal.
- They stop at a small caravan and Lili buys herself an old pair of nunchaku, to which Ifir adds some money to outfit it with spiked leather.
- The two girls find the hideout of the bandits that stole Ningal, a hidden entrance by some rocks next to the river. The door is guarded by a gnoll, which Ifir paralyzes with her poisoned kama.
- They sneak inside, down a long, straight corridor, and stop at a wooden door. The guard lets them pass, for some gold and the promise of carnal favors.
- Inside the hideout is a dogfighting pit. Ningal paces around the edge of the ring, facing off with three rabid looking jackals while the crowd of brigands gambles and shouts around them.
- Dama, the “Brass Master” (more like ass master, amirite?) and owner of this secret operation, arrives. Ifir thinks he’s hot. She also notices him playing with a gold ring.
- Ifir goes to flirt/negotiate with him, and Lili impatiently drops down into the pit to protect Ningal.
- One of Dama’s brutes pulls a lever that shrinks the pit’s diameter, bringing Lili and her tiger closer to the jackals.
- Dama offers Ifir the chance to fight in Lili’s place, which she accepts when he declines a public fuck instead. Lili decides to stay anyway and fight alongside Ifir. Ifir swears that she’s going to take the ring Dama is playing with, at which point Dama orders two more jackals be released into the pit.
- After successfully fighting off the jackals, Ifir is about to claim victory when Dama runs back behind his throne. The front door is broken in by a battering ram and knights fill the room, fighting and arresting brigands left and right, and Ifir, Lili, and Ningal chase after Dama and his gnoll guards.
- They find Dama on the other side of a metal door, trying to escape through a ladder. She threatens him, takes his ring, and they all escape before the knights can break the metal door down.
- Ifir tells the gnolls “You work for me now.” and gives Dama the option of following along. They are pursued a ways by the knights but they eventually lose them and continue along the river.

## Journey to Steson
- Lili guides Ifir and the others to Kidwy, her home. It’s a small desert city with sandstone buildings and motifs of Ifir’s father everywhere. This is when she realizes that Lili is a Child of Light, a human worshipper of Elduin, her father.
- Lili invites the group to relax and recuperate at the public baths. It’s here that Ifir first beds Dama after a heartfelt conversation and some revealing secrets. Lili and the gnolls get up to their own fun.
- When they’re ready to leave, the group packs up and heads to the ferry which will take them into Steson. There are others waiting for the ferry: a robed dragonborn, a gnome cleric (Salgrim), and an elderly tourist-y couple.
- The ferry arrives and they head out for Steson. 
- It takes a day, but eventually they arrive at the docks. Ifir brings them all (including Salgrim, who says she has business at the castle) to Castle Spellsong where she is met by Royal Advisor Tybalt and her half-sisters Yuna (9) and Setra (14).
- Queen Mira, Ifir’s mother, gave birth not long before they arrived and is still recovering from labor. Meanwhile her sisters have been helping to run the city, in particular investigating a string of kidnappings throughout the city.
- In the meantime, Ifir brings the party to the Willywock Inn where they meet Mama Juniper and Ifir helps her second mama out with a brownie problem.
- They have their rooms, but Dama comes to see Ifir during the night to ask her on a proper date.
- The next day they do have a date, which involves Dama bringing her down the docks and gambling her for a box of contraband, buying her some vials for Lala’s poison, and ends with them being called to the castle by a servant.
- When they arrive they are told that the young prince has been kidnapped.

## Prince Elomar
- The kidnappings have reached the castle and the young prince was taken.
- Without much to go on, the party heads to the docks to investigate.
- The smugglers that Dama and Ifir had been gambling with were mostly arrested, but Ifir manages to find the woman.
- After a quick altercation and a "zone of truth" from Salgrim, Ifir finds out that there's strange activity going on in the sewers.
- After entering the sewers and trying to keep stealth with a large party, Ifir finds a room with two hooded figures.
- She strikes, eventually subduing them and unlocking a secret passageway that shoots off from the sewers, into the catacombs beneath the city.
- The catacombs come with their own dangers, namely some nasty rats and some bomb traps, but the team is able to disable the traps and take a cultist hostage. He can't speak, and beneath the half-mask his face is terribly scarred and he has no tongue.
- The cultist makes a break for it into a large, open cavern in which several cultists are fighting off a rat king.
- After a quick battle with both the cultists and the rat king, the team finds their way to the makeshift dungeon, where the kidnapped victims have been hidden.
- Dama stays to help them out of the cells while the others move on into an underground temple.
- At the far end there are six cultists, two behind a large altar holding Elomar and chanting a spell. The others turn and engage in combat with the party.
- Halfway through the fight the cultists transform into hulking monsters.
- Dama arrives in time to defend Ifir and the party quickly manages to subdue them.
- The leaders, revealed to be the elderly tourists from the ferry, hold Elomar hostage.
- There's an explosion from above and the dragonborn from the ferry arrives, giving Ifir the chance to save Elomar.
- The dragonborn, whom Sal knows, enters the temple with several guards to arrest the cultists.
- It is revealed that Elomar has been changed, if only slightly. One small black horn pokes out from his curly head and a wispy black tail sways behind him.
- The party is addressed by one of the kidnapped victims, a Mr. Horace Seabring. He invites them to come stay at his resort for free.
- Back at the castle, Mira welcomes them and accepts Elomar as he is, happy he is safe.
