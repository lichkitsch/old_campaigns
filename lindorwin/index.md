# Lindorwin
Lindorwin is a medium-sized world with a varied landscape. The world is fifty percent water and the land has everything from mountains and swamps to deserts and wastes. Lindorwin exists at the nexus between 7 other planes. These other planes blend and bleed into Lindorwin, bringing strange creatures, phenomena, and sometimes disaster. 

## Planes
### The Light
The Light is a cold plane of bright white light. It is the home of Aviron, Keeper of the Light, and his angelic army, of which Ifir's father is a high-ranking member. Angels take their true form in the Light, massive twisting monstrous forms with too many eyes and limbs and wings to count.

### The Dark
The Dark is the home of demons and devils. There is no sun, no stars, and no mercy from the oppressive heat that permeates every corner of the plane. The Throne of Blood, upon which the strongest entity in the Dark sits, is never held for long as the plane is at constant war with itself. Demons and devils escape the Dark through ritual or by accident and flee to Lindorwin, some merely licking their wounds before charging back into the fray.

### The Green
The Green is a wild expanse of dense forests and jungle, primal and untamed. There are a few small communities of sentient life struggling to maintain a semblance of society amidst the abundant flora and fauna of the plane, but its no big surprise when a once upstanding and right-minded citizen of these camps ends up missing, their dropped clothing and tracks leading into the wilds.

### The Deep
The Deep is a dangerous plane that lies entirely submerged in water. Churning, shifting currents spill bodies of fresh and salt water against each other. Sea life of all kinds survive beneath the waves here, including a few sentient races of fishfolk with a fear and distaste for land-dwellers. Though pockets of land exist, from mere inches to hundreds of miles below the waves, nobody has yet found the deepest point.

### The Breath
The Wind is an odd plane. As far as is known, the Wind exists entirely within a landless sky. Breaking the natural laws of Lindorwin, chunks of land float as feathers do and are inhabited by various avian races. Gravity means little here, and falling off the side of what little land exists can either swing you back around onto another floating island or shoot you off into the aether.

### The Pit
The Pit is a plane with volcanoes and fire as far as the eye can see. Filled with lizard folk and dragons, the Pit acts as a furnace that can at times burn hotter than even the Dark. Powerful weapons are forged here, weilded by dragonborn warriors who bring dark secrets from the heart of fire to the world of Lindorwin.

### The Pale
The Pale is the strangest of the planes. The Pale is a sweeping, gray desert speckled with ruins of a thousand civilizations, inhabited by the dead and the undying alike. Secrets are kept here beneath the ash-sand, whispers and tomes of the dead and ghosts of those who have passed from Lindorwin, some graceful and forlorn and some dangerous and malevolent. Nothing grows here, and mortal souls are quickly eaten away until their ghosts join the parade of decay.

### The Gilded
An eighth plane, rumored to exist, is believed to hold a paradise-like afterlife.
