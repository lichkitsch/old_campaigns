Dama stepped out onto the balcony, steaming cup of tea warming his hands. The morning air was brisk and the sun was just rising up over the hills, golden light spilling out over the lake. Ifir stood leaning against the marble railing. Her sheer nightgown left little to the imagination; her ass in clear view from where Dama stood. He snuck up behind her and pinched it. She squealed and jumped a bit, slapped him on the arm, and pulled his arm around her waist, bringing his face close for a kiss on the cheek.
