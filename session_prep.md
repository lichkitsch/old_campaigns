# Session Prep

## Character and Connection to World
Revisit the PCs situation and relationship with the world and the NPCs around them.

## Strong Start
Set up plot hooks and openers for the session to start with a bang.

## Secrets and Clues to Discover
Work backwards to set up clues and secrets that lead the PCs through the quest. What happened that put these clues in place in the first place? What do they mean? Who else knows and how do they know?

## Fantastic Locations
Spend time detailing the locations that the PCs are visiting. Stick to the theme and know what each room looks like and the objects that are present.

## Interesting NPCs
Develop the NPCs; know who they are, how they look and sound and act, how they feel, and whether they are forthcoming, helpful, and suspicious or not.

## Cool (Relevant) Monsters
Stick to the theme, or have some reason as to why the monster doesn't belong. Separate the individual creatures with identifying features (eyepatch, missing teeth, unique weapons) to make navigating conversation and combat efficient.

## Useful Rewards
Include valuable magic items and interesting treasures to reward your players.
