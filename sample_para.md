Magic, sustainability, history, order, equity.
Fear of nature becoming imbalanced due to technology.

All are welcome in Anjouville provided they:
1. Speak the location of the city to no soul, living or dead.
2. Contribute to the good of the city and the good of the world.
    - Children and pregnant peoples bring joy and life to the world and are thus exempt from contributions.
3. Take only that which they need to comfortably survive and no more.
    - Those who fall to greed must pay back their sin to the community ten-fold.
4. Trade with the surface world is permitted with a license granted by the Conseil de Maitres.
5. Personal property belongs to the individual, public property belongs to us all.
6. The sacred crystals must be left in their place, untouched.

## Emotional
Family, tradition, nature, magic, community.
Secrecy and magic help to protect the magic within the mountain.
